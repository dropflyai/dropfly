# üéØ Project Initialization Prompt Templates

## üö® CRITICAL: NEW PROJECT STARTUP SEQUENCE

**When user says "let's start a new project" - follow this EXACT sequence:**

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering (MANDATORY: ONE AT A TIME)
```
üî¥ STOP - Ask these questions ONE AT A TIME until complete:

1. What is the business/client name?
2. What type of business is it? (restaurant, retail, service, etc.)
3. What is the main goal of this project? (demo site, full website, specific features?)
4. Do they have an existing website or online presence to research?
5. What are the key features they need? (AI chat, voice agent, e-commerce, etc.)
6. What is their brand colors/aesthetic preference?
7. Who is their target audience?
8. What is the timeline/priority level?

‚úÖ ONLY proceed to Phase 2 when ALL requirements are documented
```

### Phase 2: Project Setup & Logging Infrastructure
```
üî• CRITICAL: Set up complete logging system BEFORE any development

1. Create project folder with standard structure:
   mkdir project-name
   cd project-name
   mkdir .logs .docs .research .assets .credentials .troubleshoot .progress

2. Initialize comprehensive logging system:
   touch .logs/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-project-initialization.md
   touch SESSION-MEMORY.md
   touch CLAUDE.md

3. Start logging IMMEDIATELY:
   - Log EVERY decision in .logs/YYYY-MM-DD-session.md
   - Check ALL existing logs before starting ANY work
   - Update SESSION-MEMORY.md after EVERY major task

4. Initialize Git repository:
   git init
   echo ".credentials/" >> .gitignore
   echo ".env*" >> .gitignore
```

### Phase 3: Enterprise Backend Framework
## üöÄ Primary Project Kickoff Prompt

**Use this prompt to start ANY new project with enterprise-grade backend:**

```
I'm starting a new project. Apply the Enterprise Backend Framework methodology:

PROJECT DETAILS:
- Name: [PROJECT_NAME]
- Type: [e.g., HOA management, e-commerce, SaaS platform]
- Primary users: [e.g., residents, customers, team members]
- Scale: [e.g., 100-500 users per tenant, 1000+ organizations]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Each [TENANT_TYPE] completely isolated
2. **Core Entities**: [List 5-8 main database entities]
3. **User Roles**: [List user permission levels]
4. **Key Features**: [List 3-5 primary features]

IMPLEMENTATION STANDARD:
- Database: 15+ tables with comprehensive relationships
- Security: RLS policies on ALL tables with multi-tenant isolation
- Performance: Strategic indexes for all expected queries
- Automation: Triggers for counters, audit logs, and notifications
- Business Logic: Edge Functions with proper validation
- Monitoring: Health checks, performance tracking, and alerting
- Documentation: Complete setup guides and operational procedures

TARGET: Enterprise-grade, production-ready backend infrastructure in 3-4 hours.

Start with database schema design and work through each phase systematically.
```

## üîç Quality Review Prompt

**Use this to audit any backend implementation:**

```
Perform a comprehensive Enterprise Backend Framework audit on this implementation:

SECURITY AUDIT:
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security enabled on ALL tables?
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant policies prevent cross-tenant data access?
- ‚úÖ All user inputs properly validated and sanitized?
- ‚úÖ JWT authentication properly implemented?
- ‚úÖ Audit logging captures all sensitive operations?

PERFORMANCE AUDIT:
- ‚úÖ Indexes on all foreign keys and frequently queried columns?
- ‚úÖ Query performance optimized (target <200ms average)?
- ‚úÖ Slow query monitoring implemented?
- ‚úÖ Connection pooling and resource management configured?

SCALABILITY AUDIT:
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant architecture supports unlimited growth?
- ‚úÖ Database design normalized and efficient?
- ‚úÖ Real-time features implemented without blocking?
- ‚úÖ Background jobs and automation properly configured?

OPERATIONAL AUDIT:

- ‚úÖ Backup and recovery procedures documented?
- ‚úÖ Error tracking and debugging tools configured?
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete and accurate?

If ANY item fails, implement immediately to meet enterprise standards.
```

## ‚ö° Quick Stack Decision Prompt

**Use this for rapid technology decisions:**

```
Based on these project requirements, recommend the optimal backend stack:

PROJECT: [Brief description]
SCALE: [Expected users/data volume]
FEATURES: [Key functionality needed]
TIMELINE: [Development timeline]
BUDGET: [Infrastructure budget considerations]

EVALUATE:
- Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase) vs alternatives
- Authentication: Supabase Auth vs custom
- Real-time: Supabase Realtime vs WebSockets
- Functions: Edge Functions vs traditional API
- Storage: Supabase Storage vs cloud providers
- Monitoring: Built-in vs third-party tools

Provide specific recommendations with justification and implementation approach.
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design Prompt

**Use this for complex system design:**

```
Design a comprehensive backend architecture for:

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
- Industry: [e.g., Real Estate, Healthcare, FinTech]
- Business Model: [e.g., B2B SaaS, Marketplace, Community Platform]
- Revenue Model: [e.g., Subscriptions, Transactions, Advertising]

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Data Types: [e.g., user profiles, transactions, content, analytics]
