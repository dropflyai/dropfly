# ENGINEERING BRAIN
**Authoritative Operating System for Engineering Work**

---

## What This Is

This folder is an **Engineering Operating System**.

It defines:
- how engineering decisions are made
- how work is executed and verified
- how automation is preferred over manual steps
- how failures are recovered
- how knowledge compounds over time

This is not documentation.
This is **governance**.

If you are working in this repository, this system applies.

## Authority Hierarchy (Highest → Lowest)

1. **Constitution.md** — Law
2. **Modes.md** — Context
3. **Score.md** — Quality bar
4. **Checklist.md** — Execution gate
5. **Cleanup.md** — Hygiene enforcement
6. **Solutions/** — Institutional memory
7. **Playbook.md** — Engineering doctrine
8. **OutputContracts.md** — Deliverable structure
9. **Automations/** — Executable workflows

Lower levels may not contradict higher levels.

## Required Workflow (Every Task)

Every engineering task MUST follow this order:

1. Declare Engineering Mode(s)
2. Run the **Preflight Checklist**
3. Consult **SolutionIndex** and **AutomationIndex**
4. Execute using automation where available
5. Verify with evidence
6. Complete cleanup
7. Update memory if new knowledge was discovered
8. Pass the Completion Gate

Skipping steps is a violation.

## How to Start a Task

Before writing code, you must be able to answer:

- What mode am I in?
- What is the smallest correct solution?
- What automation already exists?
- How will I verify correctness?
- What cleanup will be required?

If you cannot answer these, stop.

---

## How This System Gets Smarter

The system improves through:
- Solutions (repeatable answers)
- Golden Paths (mandatory execution)
- Regressions (failure memory)
- Automations (executable truth)

If something repeats, it must be documented or automated.

---

## Deletion and Cleanup

Engineering has explicit authority to delete:
- dead code
- unused folders
- obsolete scripts
- abandoned experiments

Deletion must follow Cleanup rules and be verified.

---

## Automation Doctrine

- Prefer automation over manual work
- Repair broken automation
- Never silently fall back to manual steps
- Document recovery paths

"I can't automate this" is not an acceptable end state.

---

## Enforcement

This system is binding.

Violations must be corrected before work proceeds.

Repeated violations may be logged as regressions.

---

## Final Principle

> **Engineering quality is measured by system behavior over time.**

Correctness, clarity, automation, and memory matter more than speed.

---

**If you are here, you are expected to operate at a senior+ engineering level.**
