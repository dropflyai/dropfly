# CRASH RECOVERY CHECKPOINT - LeadFly DNS Session
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-28  
**Session Type**: DNS Troubleshooting & Deployment Recovery

## CURRENT TASK BEING WORKED ON
- Resolving SSL certificate issue for www.leadflyai.com
- DNS configuration troubleshooting for custom domain

## CURRENT STATE SUMMARY
### Working Components:
- ✅ LeadFly application deployed successfully to Vercel
- ✅ Working deployment URL: https://leadfly-htj03ff68-dropflyai.vercel.app
- ✅ SSL certificate valid on Vercel deployment URL
- ✅ Application functionality confirmed working

### Issues in Progress:
- ❌ Custom domain leadflyai.com not resolving (NXDOMAIN)
- ❌ www.leadflyai.com not resolving (NXDOMAIN)
- ⚠️ User reports DNS records added but propagation not complete

## FILES MODIFIED
- `/Users/rioallen/Documents/OS-App-Builder/LEARNING-GROWTH/user-preferences.md`
  - Added project structure change: OS-App-Builder → DropFly-OS-App-Builder

## COMMANDS EXECUTED
```bash
# Domain verification
vercel domains ls
vercel domains inspect leadflyai.com
vercel --prod

# DNS troubleshooting
nslookup leadflyai.com
nslookup www.leadflyai.com
curl -I https://www.leadflyai.com
curl -I https://leadflyai.com
```

## ERRORS ENCOUNTERED
1. **DNS Resolution Failure**: Both leadflyai.com and www.leadflyai.com returning NXDOMAIN
2. **SSL Certificate Issue**: Original error was due to DNS not pointing to Vercel
3. **Nameserver Mismatch**: Domain using Google Domains nameservers instead of Vercel's

## VERCEL DOMAIN CONFIGURATION
- Domain: leadflyai.com
- Project: leadfly-ai  
- Status: Not configured properly
- Required A Record: `A leadflyai.com 76.76.21.21`
- Current Nameservers: ns-cloud-d[1-4].googledomains.com
- Intended Nameservers: ns1.vercel-dns.com, ns2.vercel-dns.com

## NEXT STEPS PLANNED
1. Wait for DNS propagation (24-48 hours)
2. Verify DNS resolution with nslookup/dig
3. Test SSL certificate once DNS resolves
4. Document successful resolution

## IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND
- Use working Vercel URL: https://leadfly-htj03ff68-dropflyai.vercel.app
- DNS propagation checker: https://dnschecker.org/#A/leadflyai.com

## PROJECT LOCATION
- LeadFly Project Path: `/Users/rioallen/Documents/DropFly/knowledge-engine/leadfly-integration`
- Last Successful Deployment: Completed successfully
- Build Status: ✅ No errors

## CRITICAL NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION
- DNS records reportedly added by user but not yet propagated
- User provided PNG screenshot of DNS config but content not visible
- Need to verify actual DNS records configuration once propagation complete
- SSL certificate issue will resolve automatically once DNS propagates

**Recovery Status**: Ready for next session  
**Blocked On**: DNS propagation timing  
**User Action Required**: Wait for DNS propagation or verify DNS records
