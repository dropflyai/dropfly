# Design Intelligence Framework — Authoritative

Don't reinvent wheels. Study what works.
Design intelligence grounds creativity in evidence.

---

## Purpose

Design intelligence exists to:
- identify proven patterns in your space
- learn from competitor successes/failures
- discover design trends affecting user expectations
- find differentiation opportunities
- build evidence-based design direction

Original doesn't mean uninformed.

## Design Intelligence Areas

### 1. Competitive UX Analysis
What competitors are doing (and how well).

### 2. Pattern Research
What design patterns dominate this space.

### 3. Trend Analysis
What's changing in UX/UI expectations.

### 4. User Review Mining
What users say about competitor experiences.

### 5. Best-in-Class Examples
Exemplary designs to learn from.
