# Demographic Analysis Framework — Authoritative

Demographics tell you who they are.
Psychographics tell you why they buy.
You need both.

---

## Purpose

Demographic analysis exists to:
- understand target users beyond assumptions
- inform persona development with real data
- guide visual and tonal decisions
- identify segments and their differences
- predict behavior and preferences

Design for "users" is vague. Design for specifics.
