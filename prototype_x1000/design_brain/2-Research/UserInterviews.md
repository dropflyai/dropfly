# User Interview Framework — Authoritative

Interviews reveal what analytics cannot.
Skip interviews and you'll design based on assumptions.

---

## Purpose

User interviews exist to:
- understand user mental models
- discover unmet needs
- validate assumptions
- uncover context and workflow
- hear problems in users' own words

Good interviews generate surprises. If you're not surprised, you're not listening.

---

## Interview Planning

### Sample Size
```
DISCOVERY RESEARCH: 8-12 interviews
VALIDATION RESEARCH: 5-8 interviews
QUICK CHECK: 3-5 interviews

Recruit until you hear patterns repeat.
```

## Question Design

### Good Questions
```
"Tell me about the last time you [did X]..."
"Walk me through how you typically [do X]..."
"What happens when [situation]?"
"Why is that important to you?"
"What would happen if you couldn't [do X]?"
"How did you decide to [use X]?"
```

### Bad Questions (Avoid)
```
"Would you use a feature that [does X]?" → Leading
"Do you like [product]?" → Yes/no
"How often do you [X]?" → Memory unreliable
"What features would you want?" → Users aren't designers
"Is this useful?" → Social desirability bias
```

### Follow-Up Probes
```
"Tell me more about that..."
"Why do you think that is?"
"Can you give me a specific example?"
"What do you mean by [term they used]?"
"How did that make you feel?"
"What happened next?"
```

### After All Interviews

1. **Affinity Mapping**
   - Write each insight on a sticky note
   - Group related insights

2. **Pattern Identification**
   - What did 3+ people mention?
   - What surprised you?
   - What contradicted assumptions?

3. **Quote Banking**
   - Save powerful quotes
   - Organize by theme
   - Use in presentations
