# Jobs-to-Be-Done Framework — Authoritative

People don't buy products. They hire them to do a job.
Understand the job, and you'll design the right solution.

---

## Purpose

Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) exists to:
- focus on outcomes, not features
- understand user motivations
- reveal competitive alternatives
- guide innovation and prioritization
- create durable product strategy

Features become obsolete. Jobs endure.

## Core Concept

### The Job Statement
A job is the progress a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance.

### Structure
```
When [SITUATION/CONTEXT],
I want to [MOTIVATION/GOAL],
so I can [EXPECTED OUTCOME/PROGRESS].
```

### Example
```
When I'm onboarding a new team member,
I want to get them access to all the right tools,
so I can have them productive in their first week.
```

---

## Job Dimensions

### 1. Functional Job
The practical task to accomplish.
```
"Help me [accomplish X task]"
```

### 2. Emotional Job
How they want to feel.
```
"Help me feel [emotion]"
```

### 3. Social Job
How they want to be perceived.
```
"Help me be seen as [perception]"
```

### Example: Project Management Tool
```
FUNCTIONAL: Help me track project status
EMOTIONAL: Help me feel in control, not anxious
SOCIAL: Help me look organized to my boss
```

## Forces Diagram

Four forces influence switching between solutions:

```
                    FORCES PUSHING TOWARD CHANGE
                              │
        ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
        │                     │                     │
        │  Push of Current    │  Pull of New        │
        │  Situation          │  Solution           │
        │  (frustration)      │  (attraction)       │
        │                     │                     │
        └─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┘
                              │
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                              │
        ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
        │                     │                     │
        │  Anxiety of New     │  Habit of Current   │
        │  Solution           │  Behavior           │
        │  (uncertainty)      │  (comfort)          │
        │                     │                     │
        └─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┘
                              │
                   FORCES OPPOSING CHANGE
```

### Forces Analysis Template
```
PUSH (frustration with status quo):
-
-

PULL (attraction to new solution):
-
-

ANXIETY (concerns about switching):
-
-

HABIT (comfort with current):
-
-
```

---

## Outcome Statements

Define desired outcomes for each job:

### Structure
```
[DIRECTION] + [MEASURE] + [OBJECT OF CONTROL] + [CONTEXT]
```

### Direction Options
- Minimize (time, effort, cost, risk)
- Maximize (accuracy, completeness, throughput)
- Increase (likelihood, satisfaction)
- Reduce (errors, confusion, steps)

### Examples
```
MINIMIZE the time it takes to find the right document
MINIMIZE the likelihood of missing an important follow-up
MAXIMIZE the accuracy of sales forecasts
REDUCE the effort required to onboard new team members
INCREASE the likelihood that reports are accurate
```

---

## Job Prioritization

### Opportunity Score
```
Opportunity = Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)
```

Where:
- Importance: How important is this job (1-10)
- Satisfaction: How satisfied with current solutions (1-10)

### Opportunity Matrix
```
| Job Statement | Importance | Satisfaction | Opportunity |
|---------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
|               |            |              |             |

High Opportunity = High Importance + Low Satisfaction
```

### Prioritization Visual
```
               HIGH IMPORTANCE
                     │
    ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
    │                │                │
    │   OVER-SERVED  │  OPPORTUNITY   │
    │   (reduce)     │  (invest)      │
    │                │                │
HIGH├────────────────┼────────────────┤LOW
SAT │                │                │SAT
    │   TABLE STAKES │  LOW PRIORITY  │
    │   (maintain)   │  (ignore)      │
    │                │                │
    └────────────────┼────────────────┘
                     │
               LOW IMPORTANCE
```

---

## From Jobs to Features

### Bad: Feature-First
```
"We should add a dashboard"
(Why? For whom? What job?)
```

### Good: Job-First
```
"Users need to know if their system is healthy"
→ What's the job? "Know my system status quickly"
→ What outcomes matter? "Minimize time to spot problems"
→ Now we can design the right solution (maybe a dashboard, maybe alerts, maybe both)
```

---

## Competitive Analysis Through JTBD

### Beyond Feature Comparison
Instead of: "Competitor has X feature"
Ask: "What job does that feature serve?"

### True Competition
Your competition includes:
- Direct competitors
- Different products serving same job
- Manual workarounds
- Doing nothing

### Example: Video Conference Tool
```
Job: "Collaborate with remote colleagues"

Competition:
- Other video tools (Zoom, Meet)
- Phone calls
- In-person meetings (travel)
- Async tools (Slack, email)
- Not meeting at all
```

---

## JTBD Interview Template

```
PARTICIPANT: _______________
DATE: _______________

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TIMELINE (reconstruct the "hiring" decision)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

First Thought
When did you first think you needed something?


Event 1
What happened that made the situation urgent?


Event 2
What did you try first?


Passive Looking
How did you become aware of options?


Active Looking
When did you start actively searching?


Deciding
What made you choose [solution]?


Consuming
What happened when you first used it?


Satisfaction
How well is the job being done now?


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FORCES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Push (what was frustrating about before):


Pull (what attracted you to new solution):


Anxiety (what concerns did you have):


Habit (what was comfortable about before):


```

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- Defining jobs as features ("use the dashboard")
- Too narrow ("click the button")
- Too broad ("be successful")
- Ignoring emotional/social dimensions
- Not including context
- Solution-embedded jobs ("sync my data to CRM")

---

## Output Artifacts

After JTBD analysis, you should have:
- [ ] Main job statements
- [ ] Job hierarchy
- [ ] Forces analysis
- [ ] Outcome statements
- [ ] Prioritized opportunity scores
- [ ] Competitive landscape (by job)
