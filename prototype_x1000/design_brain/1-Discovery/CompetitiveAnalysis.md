# Competitive Analysis Framework — Authoritative

Know your competition before you design.
Ignorance of the market leads to undifferentiated products.

---

## Purpose

Competitive analysis exists to:
- understand the current solution landscape
- identify differentiation opportunities
- learn from others' successes and failures
- set user expectations baseline
- inform positioning and messaging

You cannot differentiate without knowing what exists.

## Competitor Identification

### Direct Competitors
Same problem, same user, same approach.
```
| Competitor | URL | Positioning | Primary User |
|------------|-----|-------------|--------------|
|            |     |             |              |
```

### Indirect Competitors
Same problem, different approach.
```
| Competitor | URL | Approach | Why Users Choose |
|------------|-----|----------|------------------|
|            |     |          |                  |
```

### Substitutes
Different solution to same underlying need.
```
| Substitute | What Need It Serves | Why Users Choose |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|
|            |                     |                  |

- [ ] Competitor profiles (3-5 deep dives)
- [ ] Feature comparison matrix
- [ ] Positioning map
- [ ] Gap analysis
- [ ] Design implications document
- [ ] Differentiation strategy
