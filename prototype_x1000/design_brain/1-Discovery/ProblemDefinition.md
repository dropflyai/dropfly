# Problem Definition Framework — Authoritative

A well-defined problem is half-solved.
A poorly-defined problem leads to wasted effort.

---

## Purpose

Problem definition exists to:
- ensure we solve the right problem
- create shared understanding
- prevent scope creep
- provide a north star for decisions
- enable measurement of success

Never design without a written problem definition.

## The Problem Statement Formula

### Structure
```
[USER TYPE] needs a way to [USER NEED/GOAL]
because [INSIGHT/PAIN POINT],
but currently [CURRENT STATE/BARRIER].
```

### Example
```
Small business owners need a way to track customer interactions
because they're losing deals due to forgotten follow-ups,
but currently they rely on memory and scattered notes.
```

## Problem Definition Template

```
PROJECT: _______________
VERSION: _______________
DATE: _______________
AUTHOR: _______________

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM STATEMENT
[One sentence that captures the core problem]


WHO HAS THIS PROBLEM
[Specific user type — not "everyone"]


WHAT IS THE PROBLEM
[Observable behavior or pain point]


WHY DOES IT MATTER
[Impact on user and business]


WHEN/WHERE DOES IT OCCUR
[Context and triggers]


CURRENT ALTERNATIVES
[How users solve this today]


WHY ALTERNATIVES FAIL
[Gaps in current solutions]


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EVIDENCE
[Data, quotes, research supporting this problem]


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
[Observable outcomes if problem is solved]


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CONSTRAINTS
[What limits our solution space]


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OUT OF SCOPE
[What we are explicitly NOT solving]

## 5 Whys Analysis

Dig deeper to find root causes.

### Process
```
Problem: Users don't complete the onboarding flow.

Why? → They abandon at step 3.
Why? → Step 3 asks for payment info.
Why is that a problem? → They don't trust us yet.
Why don't they trust us? → They haven't seen value.
Why haven't they seen value? → We gate value behind payment.

ROOT CAUSE: We ask for payment before demonstrating value.
```

### Template
```
SURFACE PROBLEM:


WHY 1:

WHY 2:

WHY 3:

WHY 4:

WHY 5:

ROOT CAUSE:

```

## Problem Validation Checklist

Before accepting a problem definition:

### Is it Real?
- [ ] Evidence exists (data, research, quotes)
- [ ] Multiple users experience this
- [ ] It's observed, not assumed
- [ ] Stakeholders confirm it matters

### Is it Specific?
- [ ] Clear user type identified
- [ ] Specific context defined
- [ ] Not too broad ("users are frustrated")
- [ ] Measurable outcomes possible

### Is it Solvable?
- [ ] Within our capabilities
- [ ] Within our constraints
- [ ] User has agency to adopt solution
- [ ] Not dependent on external factors

### Is it Valuable?
- [ ] Solving it matters to users
- [ ] Solving it matters to business
- [ ] Worth the investment
- [ ] Competitive advantage possible

## Problem Framing Techniques

### 1. Jobs-to-Be-Done Frame
```
When [SITUATION],
I want to [MOTIVATION],
so I can [EXPECTED OUTCOME].
```

### 2. Point of View (POV) Statement
```
[USER] needs [NEED] because [INSIGHT].
```

### 3. How Might We (HMW)
Convert problems into opportunities:
```
Problem: Users forget to follow up with leads.
HMW: How might we make follow-ups automatic?
HMW: How might we make follow-ups impossible to forget?
HMW: How might we reduce the need for follow-ups?
```

## Problem Prioritization Matrix

When multiple problems exist:

```
                    HIGH IMPACT
                         │
         ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
         │               │               │
         │   QUICK WINS  │  BIG BETS     │
         │   Do these    │  Plan these   │
         │   first       │  carefully    │
         │               │               │
LOW ─────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───── HIGH
EFFORT   │               │               │      EFFORT
         │   FILL-INS    │  MONEY PITS   │
         │   Do if time  │  Avoid        │
         │   permits     │               │
         │               │               │
         └───────────────┼───────────────┘
                         │
                    LOW IMPACT
```

### Scoring Template
```
| Problem | Impact (1-5) | Effort (1-5) | Confidence | Priority |
|---------|--------------|--------------|------------|----------|
|         |              |              |            |          |
```

## Problem vs. Solution

### Common Mistake
Defining the problem as a solution:

```
BAD: "Users need a dashboard"
     (This is a solution, not a problem)

GOOD: "Users can't quickly assess the health of their system"
      (This is a problem — dashboard is ONE possible solution)
```

### Test
Ask: "Could this be solved multiple ways?"
- If yes → It's a problem (good)
- If no → It's a solution disguised as a problem (reframe)

---

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
```
What we ARE solving:
-
-
-
```

### Out of Scope
```
What we are NOT solving (and why):
-
-
-
```

### Future Scope
```
What we might solve later:
-
-
-
```

---

## Success Metrics

### Define Before Designing
```
METRIC: _______________
CURRENT STATE: _______________
TARGET STATE: _______________
MEASUREMENT METHOD: _______________
TIMEFRAME: _______________
```

### Example
```
METRIC: Onboarding completion rate
CURRENT STATE: 34%
TARGET STATE: 60%
MEASUREMENT METHOD: Analytics (completed step 5 / started step 1)
TIMEFRAME: 90 days post-launch
```

## Problem Definition Review

### Before Proceeding to Design

- [ ] Problem statement is written
- [ ] Evidence supports the problem
- [ ] User type is specific
- [ ] Root cause is understood
- [ ] Success metrics are defined
- [ ] Scope is clear
- [ ] Stakeholders have signed off
- [ ] Team has shared understanding

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- Designing before defining
- Defining solution as problem
- Too broad ("improve UX")
- No evidence
- No success metrics
- Scope that keeps expanding
- Problem no one validated

---

## Output Artifacts

After problem definition, you should have:
- [ ] Written problem statement
- [ ] 5 Whys analysis
- [ ] Evidence documentation
- [ ] Success metrics
- [ ] Scope definition (in/out)
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off
