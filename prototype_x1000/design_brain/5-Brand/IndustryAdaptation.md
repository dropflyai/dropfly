# Industry Adaptation Framework — Authoritative

Every industry has visual language.
Ignore it and you lose trust. Follow it blindly and you disappear.

## Purpose

Industry adaptation exists to:
- build immediate trust with target users
- meet baseline expectations
- identify differentiation opportunities
- balance convention with innovation
- create industry-appropriate design

Know the rules before you break them.
