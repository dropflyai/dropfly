# Supply, Demand, and Elasticity

## What This Enables

**Decisions it helps make:**
- How will customers respond to a price change?
- Can we raise prices without killing demand?
- Should we compete on price or differentiate?
- How much volume will we lose/gain at different price points?

**Mistakes it prevents:**
- Leaving money on the table with prices too low
- Destroying demand with prices too high
- Assuming customers will absorb any price increase
- Racing to the bottom when you have pricing power

**Outputs it enables:**
- Price sensitivity estimates for your market
- Rational pricing decisions based on elasticity
- Understanding of when to compete on price vs. value

## The Core Mechanism

Supply and demand isn't abstract theory — it's the fundamental force governing every transaction in your business.

**Demand:** How much customers want to buy at various prices
**Supply:** How much sellers are willing to provide at various prices
**Price:** Where these forces meet

When demand exceeds supply → prices rise
When supply exceeds demand → prices fall

As an operator, you're constantly navigating these forces — sometimes you have pricing power, sometimes the market dictates terms.

## Elasticity: The Operator's Key Concept

Elasticity measures how sensitive quantity demanded is to price changes.

**Price Elasticity of Demand:**
```
% Change in Quantity Demanded
─────────────────────────────
   % Change in Price
```

| Elasticity | Meaning | Implication |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| |E| > 1 | Elastic | Price increases reduce total revenue |
| |E| = 1 | Unit elastic | Revenue stays constant |
| |E| < 1 | Inelastic | Price increases raise total revenue |

### What Makes Demand Elastic?

**More elastic (price-sensitive):**
- Many substitutes available
- Large share of customer's budget
- Plenty of time to switch
- Commodity product
- Discretionary purchase

**More inelastic (price-insensitive):**
- Few or no substitutes
- Small share of budget
- Switching is costly or slow
- Differentiated product
- Essential purchase

### Practical Example

A B2B SaaS tool costs $500/month and is deeply embedded in customer workflows.
- Few substitutes (custom-built alternatives cost 10x more)
- Small share of budget (enterprise spends millions on software)
- Switching is painful (data migration, retraining)

This product has **inelastic demand**. A 20% price increase ($600/month) will likely lose fewer than 20% of customers → revenue increases.

Contrast with a commodity API service with 5 identical competitors:
- Many substitutes
- Easy to switch
- No differentiation

This has **elastic demand**. A 10% price increase might lose 30% of customers → revenue craters.

## Estimating Your Elasticity

You rarely know elasticity precisely, but you can estimate:

### Method 1: Historical Price Changes

If you've changed prices before, compare:
- What happened to volume after the change?
- Control for other factors (seasonality, marketing, product changes)

### Method 2: Customer Research

Ask customers (carefully):
- "At what price would this be too expensive to consider?"
- "At what price would this be so cheap you'd question quality?"
- "At what price does this start to feel expensive but still worth it?"

Van Westendorp's Price Sensitivity Meter uses these questions to find acceptable price ranges.

### Method 3: Competitive Benchmarking

If competitors have raised prices:
- Did they lose share? (Elastic market)
- Did they retain customers? (Inelastic market)

### Method 4: Experiment

A/B test prices on new customers (carefully — don't show different prices to similar customers in ways they can discover).

## Strategic Implications

### If You Have Inelastic Demand

**You have pricing power.** This is valuable — don't squander it.

Actions:
- Raise prices gradually (5-15% annually is often absorbable)
- Invest in deepening switching costs
- Focus on value delivery, not price competition
- Consider value-based pricing tiers

### If You Have Elastic Demand

**You're in a competitive market.** Price is a weapon, but a dangerous one.

Actions:
- Compete on cost efficiency (if you can be the low-cost provider)
- Differentiate to reduce elasticity (create unique value)
- Avoid price wars — they destroy margins for everyone
- Find segments with lower elasticity

## Supply-Side Dynamics

Elasticity of supply matters too — especially for cost management.

**Elastic supply:** Suppliers can ramp up quickly when prices rise
- You can find alternatives
- Suppliers compete for your business

**Inelastic supply:** Suppliers can't easily increase output
- Bottlenecks in your supply chain
- Single-source dependencies
- Suppliers have power over you

### Practical Example

Hiring engineers in a hot market:
- Supply is inelastic (takes years to train new engineers)
- Demand is high (every company wants them)
- Result: Salaries rise rapidly, you pay market rates or lose candidates

Hiring for commoditized roles:
- Supply is more elastic
- You have negotiating power

## Shifts vs. Movements

A critical distinction:

**Movement along the curve:** Price changes, quantity adjusts. You're sliding along existing demand.

**Shift of the curve:** Something fundamental changes — demand at every price point moves.

### What Shifts Demand?

- **Tastes change:** Remote work increased demand for home office equipment at every price
- **Income changes:** Recession shifts demand curves down for luxury goods
- **Substitutes appear:** New competitor shifts your demand curve left
- **Complements change:** If cloud hosting gets cheaper, demand for cloud-native software shifts right

### Why This Matters

If you see sales dropping, ask: "Is this a price problem (movement) or a fundamental demand problem (shift)?"

- If movement: Price adjustments might help
- If shift: You have a deeper strategic issue to address

## Failure Modes

### 1. Assuming Infinite Elasticity

"If we cut prices 50%, we'll double volume."

Rarely true. Below certain prices, you don't reach new customers — you just discount to existing ones.

### 2. Assuming Zero Elasticity

"Customers love us. They'll pay anything."

Maybe for a while. But push too hard and alternatives emerge, or customers simply churn.

### 3. Ignoring Cross-Price Elasticity

Your product's demand is affected by prices of related products:
- **Substitutes:** Their price drops, your demand falls
- **Complements:** Their price drops, your demand rises

If AWS drops prices, demand for AWS-native tooling rises. If a competitor raises prices, you might gain customers without changing anything.

### 4. Confusing Elasticity at Different Price Points

Elasticity isn't constant. A $50 to $55 increase (10%) has different effects than $500 to $550 (10%).

At higher absolute prices, customers scrutinize more. At lower prices, percentage changes feel larger.

## The Operator's Framework

When making pricing or market decisions:

1. **Assess your elasticity:** Are you elastic or inelastic? What drives it?

2. **Identify your levers:** Can you reduce elasticity through differentiation, switching costs, or bundling?

3. **Monitor shifts:** Is demand fundamentally changing, or just responding to price?

4. **Anticipate supply dynamics:** Can your costs scale? Are you dependent on inelastic inputs?

5. **Test and learn:** Small price experiments reveal elasticity empirically.

---

## Summary

Supply and demand economics isn't theory — it's the force field you operate in.

Key principles:
- Elasticity tells you how much pricing power you have
- Inelastic demand = raise prices; elastic demand = differentiate or compete on cost
- Shifts in demand require strategic responses, not just price tweaks
- Your supply chain has its own elasticity that affects your costs
- Always ask: "What would happen to volume if we changed price by X%?"

The operators who understand these forces make better pricing decisions, anticipate market moves, and avoid competing in ways that destroy value.
