# Game Theory for Competition

## What This Enables

**Decisions it helps make:**
- How will competitors respond to our moves?
- Should we cooperate or compete aggressively?
- When should we signal vs. stay quiet?
- How do we avoid mutually destructive price wars?

**Mistakes it prevents:**
- Starting price wars you can't win
- Ignoring competitive response in strategic planning
- Missing opportunities for tacit coordination
- Being blindsided by competitor moves you should have predicted

**Outputs it enables:**
- Competitive strategy that accounts for rival behavior
- Understanding of when competition vs. cooperation makes sense
- Signaling strategies that shape competitor actions

## The Core Insight

Your outcome doesn't depend only on your actions — it depends on what competitors do too. Game theory is the systematic study of strategic interdependence.

**Key principle:** Assume your competitors are rational actors pursuing their own interests. What you do affects what they do. Plan accordingly.

## Foundational Concepts

### Players, Strategies, Payoffs

**Players:** The decision-makers (you, competitors, customers, regulators)
**Strategies:** The choices available to each player
**Payoffs:** The outcomes (profit, market share, survival) for each combination of choices

### Nash Equilibrium

A stable state where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing strategy.

**Why it matters:** Markets tend toward Nash equilibria. Understanding equilibrium helps you predict where competition settles.

**Example:** In a duopoly with identical products, if both firms price at cost, neither can improve by raising price (loses customers) or lowering price (loses money). That's equilibrium — even if it's a bad one.

## Classic Games and Business Applications

### The Prisoner's Dilemma

Two players, each can cooperate or defect. Mutual cooperation is best collectively, but individual incentives push toward defection.

| | Competitor Cooperates | Competitor Defects |
|-|----------------------|-------------------|
| **You Cooperate** | Both profit well | You get crushed |
| **You Defect** | You win big | Both profit poorly |

**Business application:** Price wars

- Both maintaining high prices = good margins for everyone
- Both cutting prices = destroyed margins for everyone
- One cuts while other holds = cutter gains share, holder loses

**The problem:** Individual incentive is to cut, but if both cut, everyone loses.

**Solutions:**
- Repeated games (see below)
- Signaling commitment
- Raising switching costs so defection hurts less
- Industry coordination (careful of antitrust)

### Repeated Games: Building Cooperation

When you compete over time (not one-shot), cooperation becomes more viable.

**Tit-for-Tat strategy:**
1. Start by cooperating
2. Copy whatever your opponent did last round
3. Never defect first

This builds cooperation but punishes defection. It's been shown to be remarkably effective in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma scenarios.

**Business application:**
- Match competitor price cuts (signals retaliation)
- Return to cooperation when they do
- Never start a price war, but always respond

**Key insight:** Reputation for retaliation prevents defection. Be known as a player who responds firmly to competitive attacks.

### Chicken

Two players head toward each other. The one who swerves first (cooperates) loses face but survives. If neither swerves, both crash.

| | Competitor Swerves | Competitor Doesn't |
|-|-------------------|-------------------|
| **You Swerve** | Both survive, you look weak | You look very weak |
| **You Don't Swerve** | You look strong | Both crash |

**Business application:** Market entry standoffs

When a new entrant threatens, the incumbent might signal willingness to fight to the death. If credible, the entrant might back off.

**Danger:** If both commit, both lose. Chicken games can result in mutually destructive outcomes.

**Strategy:** Commit credibly (burn ships), but have an exit if commitment fails.

### Coordination Games

Sometimes players want the same outcome but need to coordinate on which one.

**Example:** Industry standards. Everyone benefits from one standard, but each prefers their own standard to be the winner.

**Business application:** Platform competition

Early moves to establish a standard can lock in advantage. But fighting over incompatible standards can delay market development and hurt everyone.

## Strategic Moves

### First-Mover Advantage

Moving first can lock in customers, set standards, or establish reputation.

**When it works:**
- Network effects create lock-in
- Learning curves give cost advantages
- Resources are limited

**When it backfires:**
- Fast followers learn from your mistakes
- Technology changes before you scale
- You educate the market, competitors harvest

### Commitment Devices

Credibly limiting your own options can shape competitor behavior.

**Examples:**
- Publicly announcing price increases (hard to back down)
- Building excess capacity (signals willingness to fight for share)
- Signing long-term contracts (can't easily pivot)

**The logic:** If competitors know you can't retreat, they may not attack.

### Signaling

Sending messages through actions (not just words) about your intentions or capabilities.

**Effective signals:**
- Price cuts that would be irrational without commitment to fight
- Capacity investments that only make sense if you expect to win
- Executive statements backed by board decisions

**Weak signals:**
- Vague threats
- Actions easily reversed
- Statements contradicted by behavior

## Competitive Dynamics

### Price Wars: How They Start and How to Avoid Them

**How they start:**
- Excess capacity with high fixed costs (need to fill capacity)
- New entrant trying to buy share
- Desperation (company fighting for survival)
- Misread of competitor intentions
- Undifferentiated products

**How to avoid them:**
- Differentiate to reduce direct comparison
- Signal commitment to maintaining prices
- Avoid triggering competitor desperation
- Create switching costs
- Compete on dimensions other than price

**How to end them:**
- Exit or cede market to competitor
- Absorb short-term losses to outlast competitor
- Merge with competitor
- Tacitly coordinate on price stability (legally)

### Predatory Pricing

Pricing below cost to drive out competitors, then raising prices.

**When it works (rarely):**
- You have much deeper pockets
- Competitor can't survive the war
- Entry barriers prevent new entrants after you win
- Antitrust enforcement is weak

**Why it usually fails:**
- It's expensive
- Competitors may have patient capital
- New entrants may appear when you raise prices
- Antitrust risk

### Capacity Competition

Building capacity can signal intention to fight for market share.

**Excess capacity as commitment:** "We've already built the plants; we're going to compete."

**Risk:** If everyone builds excess capacity, industry returns suffer.

### Product Proliferation

Filling product space so competitors have no gap to enter.

**Example:** Breakfast cereal companies launching countless varieties to occupy shelf space and segments.

**Risk:** Complexity costs. Managing many products is expensive.

## Reading Competitors

### Inferring Strategy

Watch competitor actions:
- Hiring patterns (what capabilities are they building?)
- Patent filings (what technology are they developing?)
- Executive statements (what future are they imagining?)
- Pricing moves (are they building or harvesting?)
- Capacity investments (are they betting on growth?)

### Anticipating Response

Before any major move, ask:
1. How will each competitor likely respond?
2. What's their rational reaction?
3. What if they don't respond rationally?
4. How do we respond to their response?

Always think two moves ahead.

## Multi-Player Dynamics

Most markets have more than two players. This complicates things.

### Free Rider Problem

In multi-player cooperation, someone may defect while others cooperate.

**Example:** Industry-wide marketing campaigns. Everyone benefits, but each company hopes others will pay.

### Coalition Formation

Players may form alliances against common threats.

**Watch for:**
- When might competitors align against you?
- When might you align with a competitor against a bigger threat?
- How stable are coalitions?

### Sequential Entry

First movers face later entrants who've learned from their experience.

**Implication:** Early mover playbooks may not work for later entrants, and vice versa.

---

## Failure Modes

### 1. Assuming Competitors Won't Respond

"We'll cut price and gain share."

They will respond. Your temporary share gain may trigger a war that destroys everyone's margins.

### 2. Overestimating Commitment

"We told them we'd fight to the death."

Talk is cheap. Competitors discount threats unless backed by irrevocable commitments.

### 3. Starting Wars You Can't Finish

Once you initiate aggression, you may be stuck. Have a credible path to victory before starting.

### 4. Ignoring New Players

Game theory often focuses on existing competitors. But new entrants, adjacent players, and substitutes reshape the game.

### 5. Assuming Rationality

Most actors are mostly rational. But sometimes they're not. Distressed competitors, ego-driven founders, or poorly incentivized managers may act irrationally. Plan for it.

## The Operator's Framework

When planning competitive moves:

1. **Map the game:** Who are the players? What are their options? What are their incentives?

2. **Model responses:** How will competitors react? Run scenarios.

3. **Consider repeated play:** Is this a one-shot or ongoing interaction? Repeated games change optimal strategies.

4. **Signal strategically:** What do you want competitors to believe? How do you credibly communicate it?

5. **Build optionality:** Avoid locking yourself into single strategies. Keep room to adjust.

6. **Prepare for irrationality:** Plan for worst-case competitor behavior, not just expected behavior.

---

## Summary

Competition is strategic interdependence. Your moves affect others; their moves affect you.

Key principles:
- Assume competitors are rational and will respond to your actions
- Repeated games allow for cooperation that one-shot games don't
- Credible commitment can shape competitor behavior
- Signaling matters, but only when backed by action
- Price wars destroy value — avoid starting them, be prepared to fight them
- Always think two moves ahead: what's their response to your move?

The best operators don't just react to competition — they shape it.
