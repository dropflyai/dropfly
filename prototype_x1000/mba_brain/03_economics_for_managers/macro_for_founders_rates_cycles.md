# Macroeconomics for Founders: Rates, Cycles, and Context

## What This Enables

**Decisions it helps make:**
- When should we raise capital?
- How do we plan for recession?
- Should we hire aggressively or conserve cash?
- How do interest rates affect our business and customers?

**Mistakes it prevents:**
- Raising money at bad valuations in overheated markets
- Being caught without runway when capital markets close
- Underestimating how macro conditions affect customer behavior
- Planning as if current conditions will persist forever

**Outputs it enables:**
- Capital strategy aligned with macro cycles
- Scenario planning that includes macroeconomic factors
- Understanding of how rates, inflation, and cycles affect your business

## Why Macro Matters for Operators

You operate in an economic context. Macro conditions affect:
- Customer willingness to spend
- Availability and cost of capital
- Competition intensity (startups die in recessions, consolidation increases)
- Talent availability and cost
- Currency and international operations

You don't control macro. But you can understand it and adapt.

## Interest Rates: The Master Variable

Interest rates influence almost everything in the economy.

### How Rates Work

**Central bank sets short-term rates** (Fed funds rate in the US) to manage inflation and employment.

**Low rates:**
- Borrowing is cheap
- Investment increases
- Asset prices rise
- Risk appetite increases
- Startups get funded aggressively

**High rates:**
- Borrowing is expensive
- Investment decreases
- Asset prices fall
- Risk appetite shrinks
- Capital flows to safety

### Impact on Startups

**Low rate environment (2010-2021):**
- Abundant venture capital
- Growth valued over profitability
- Aggressive hiring and expansion
- High valuations

**High rate environment (2022+):**
- Capital constrained
- Profitability matters again
- Efficient growth required
- Lower valuations, fewer deals

### Impact on Customers

**B2B:**
- High rates → Customers scrutinize spending → Longer sales cycles
- Low rates → Easy budget approvals → Faster growth

**Consumer:**
- High rates → Mortgage/debt payments rise → Discretionary spending falls
- Low rates → Borrowing is cheap → More spending, housing activity

### Practical Implications

1. **Raise capital when it's available, not when you need it.** In low-rate environments, capital is abundant. In high-rate environments, it evaporates.

2. **Model customer behavior under different rate scenarios.** Your sales forecast assumes certain customer behavior — how does that change if rates stay high?

3. **Watch the yield curve.** Inverted yield curve (short rates > long rates) often predicts recession within 12-18 months.

## Economic Cycles: Expansion and Recession

Economies move through cycles. Understanding where you are helps you plan.

### The Business Cycle

```
            Peak
           /    \
          /      \
    Expansion    Contraction
        /          \
       /            \
    Trough ←──────── Recession
```

**Expansion:** GDP growing, employment rising, confidence high
**Peak:** Growth slows, inflation may rise, conditions feel euphoric
**Contraction:** GDP falling, layoffs begin, confidence drops
**Trough:** Bottom of the cycle, conditions stabilize, recovery begins

### Cycle Indicators to Watch

**Leading indicators (predict future):**
- Stock market performance
- Yield curve shape
- New orders for manufactured goods
- Building permits
- Consumer confidence

**Coincident indicators (show current state):**
- Employment
- GDP
- Industrial production
- Personal income

**Lagging indicators (confirm trends):**
- Unemployment rate (lags recovery)
- Corporate profits
- Loan delinquencies

### Planning Through Cycles

**In expansion:**
- Capital is available — raise if you need it
- Hiring is competitive — talent is expensive
- Customers buy more easily
- Risk: Overbuilding for demand that won't persist

**In contraction:**
- Capital is scarce — conserve cash
- Hiring is easier — talent becomes available
- Customers cut spending
- Risk: Cutting too deep and losing capacity

**Key principle:** Make counter-cyclical moves when you can afford to. Hire when others are laying off. Raise when others can't. Buy assets when they're cheap.

## Inflation: When Prices Rise

Inflation erodes purchasing power. Understanding it helps you navigate pricing, costs, and planning.

### Types of Inflation

**Demand-pull:** Too much money chasing too few goods
- Economy overheated
- Usually accompanies growth

**Cost-push:** Input costs rise, pushing prices up
- Supply shocks (oil, commodities)
- Can occur even in weak economies (stagflation)

### Impact on Business

**Revenue side:**
- You may be able to raise prices (if demand is inelastic)
- Contracts without escalation clauses lose real value

**Cost side:**
- Wages rise (labor expects higher pay)
- Input costs rise
- Contracts lock you into old costs (good) or old revenues (bad)

**Financing side:**
- Central bank raises rates to fight inflation
- Debt becomes more expensive
- Valuations compress

### Practical Implications

1. **Build inflation escalation into contracts** — especially long-term agreements.

2. **Monitor cost structure** — if your costs are inflating faster than your prices, margins compress.

3. **Preserve pricing power** — differentiation lets you pass through inflation.

4. **Watch real vs. nominal** — 10% revenue growth with 7% inflation is only 3% real growth.

## Currency and International Operations

If you operate internationally, currency matters.

### Exchange Rate Basics

**Your domestic currency strengthens:**
- Imports are cheaper
- Exports are less competitive
- Foreign revenue translates to fewer domestic dollars

**Your domestic currency weakens:**
- Imports are more expensive
- Exports are more competitive
- Foreign revenue translates to more domestic dollars

### Implications for Operators

**Revenue:**
- Foreign revenue fluctuates with exchange rates
- Hedging can stabilize, but adds complexity and cost

**Costs:**
- If you pay in local currency but sell in foreign, you have natural hedge
- If costs and revenues are in different currencies, you have exposure

**Pricing:**
- International pricing needs to account for currency fluctuations
- Static USD pricing may be too expensive or cheap in local markets

**Practical approach:**
- For early-stage: Accept currency exposure as part of international expansion
- For scaled: Consider hedging material exposures
- Always: Price in local currency when possible, adjust periodically

## Recession Playbook

Recessions are inevitable. Here's how to prepare and respond.

### Before Recession (Prevention)

1. **Maintain runway** — 18+ months is safer than 12
2. **Build scenario plans** — What if revenue drops 20%? 40%?
3. **Avoid over-hiring** — Layoffs are expensive and damaging
4. **Diversify customer base** — Concentrated revenue is risky
5. **Strengthen unit economics** — Healthy margins survive downturns

### During Recession (Response)

1. **Preserve cash** — Cut burn, extend runway
2. **Cut fast if needed** — Slow cuts prolong pain
3. **Focus on core** — Kill marginal projects
4. **Retain key talent** — You'll regret losing them in recovery
5. **Serve customers exceptionally** — They're stressed; loyalty is earned now
6. **Look for opportunities** — Distressed assets, talent, competitors exiting

### After Recession (Recovery)

1. **Invest ahead of demand** — Hiring and capacity take time to ramp
2. **Recapture position** — Customers who churned may return
3. **Raise capital** — Markets recover before economy fully does
4. **Avoid re-inflating cost structure** — Stay lean

## Macro Scenarios to Model

When planning, consider these macro scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Soft Landing
- Rates elevated but stable
- Slow growth, no recession
- Capital available but selective
- Implication: Focus on profitable growth

### Scenario 2: Recession
- Rates cut in response
- Demand falls
- Capital markets stressed
- Implication: Preserve cash, cut to survive

### Scenario 3: Stagflation
- High inflation + slow growth
- Rates can't fall (fighting inflation)
- Worst of both worlds
- Implication: Raise prices to cover costs, extreme efficiency

### Scenario 4: Recovery/Expansion
- Rates falling or low
- Demand growing
- Capital abundant
- Implication: Invest in growth, raise capital, hire

## Failure Modes

### 1. Ignoring Macro Entirely

"We're focused on our product. Macro doesn't matter."

It does. Your customers, capital access, and competitive dynamics all respond to macro conditions.

### 2. Over-Fitting to Current Conditions

Assuming rates will stay low forever (2021) or that contraction will persist indefinitely (2009). Conditions change.

### 3. Being Pro-Cyclical When You Should Be Counter-Cyclical

Hiring aggressively at peak, laying off at trough — the opposite of optimal. The best operators do the reverse.

### 4. Ignoring Second-Order Effects

Rates rise → Real estate slows → Mortgage lenders struggle → Fintech serving lenders struggles. Follow the chain.

### 5. Failing to Scenario Plan

One financial plan assumes one future. You should have plans for expansion, contraction, and base case.

## The Operator's Framework

When assessing macro conditions:

1. **Know where you are in the cycle:** Expansion? Contraction? Peak? Trough?

2. **Monitor key indicators:** Rates, yield curve, inflation, employment, consumer confidence

3. **Model scenarios:** What happens to your business in recession? In recovery?

4. **Maintain optionality:** Cash, flexible cost structure, diversified revenue

5. **Move counter-cyclically when possible:** Raise when others can't. Hire when others won't.

6. **Stay humble:** No one predicts macro accurately. Prepare for multiple outcomes.

## Summary

Macro conditions set the context for everything you do. You don't control them, but you can understand and adapt.

Key principles:
- Interest rates are the master variable — they affect capital, customers, and competitors
- Cycles are inevitable — plan for both expansion and contraction
- Inflation erodes value — protect yourself through pricing power and contracts
- Raise capital when available, not when desperate
- Counter-cyclical moves separate the best operators from the rest
- Always model multiple macro scenarios

The best operators treat macro as weather — unpredictable in specifics, but understandable in patterns. They build companies that can thrive across conditions, not just in fair weather.
