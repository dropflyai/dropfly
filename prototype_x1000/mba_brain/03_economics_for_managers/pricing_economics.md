# Pricing Economics

## What This Enables

**Decisions it helps make:**
- What price maximizes profit (not revenue)?
- How should we structure pricing tiers?
- When should we discount, and when should we hold the line?
- How do we capture more value without losing customers?

**Mistakes it prevents:**
- Pricing based on costs instead of value
- Leaving money on the table with uniform pricing
- Discounting reflexively and eroding margins
- Setting prices that don't align with customer segments

**Outputs it enables:**
- Pricing strategy grounded in economic principles
- Tiered pricing that captures different willingness-to-pay
- Rational approach to discounts and negotiations

## The Fundamental Pricing Equation

Profit = (Price - Cost) × Volume

Every pricing decision affects both margin and volume. The goal is to find the combination that maximizes total profit, not necessarily revenue or volume.

## Three Approaches to Pricing

### 1. Cost-Plus Pricing

**Method:** Calculate costs, add a markup percentage.

**Formula:** Price = Cost × (1 + Markup %)

**When it works:**
- Commoditized products where value is clear
- Government contracts requiring cost transparency
- Low-information environments where value is hard to assess

**Why it's usually wrong:**
- Ignores what customers value
- Ignores competitive pricing
- Leaves money on the table if customers would pay more
- Forces losses if costs spike

**Failure mode:** You might price below willingness-to-pay (losing margin) or above it (losing sales).

### 2. Competitive Pricing

**Method:** Price relative to competitors — same, premium, or discount.

**When it works:**
- Commoditized markets with visible competitor pricing
- When you can't differentiate meaningfully
- Market share battles where pricing signals matter

**Why it's often limiting:**
- Anchors you to competitors' decisions
- Ignores your unique value
- Can trigger price wars

**Failure mode:** Following a competitor into a race to the bottom that destroys industry margins.

### 3. Value-Based Pricing

**Method:** Price based on the value you create for customers.

**When it works:**
- Differentiated products
- Clear, quantifiable customer value
- Markets where customers understand their own ROI

**How to execute:**
1. Quantify the value you create (cost savings, revenue gains, risk reduction)
2. Capture a portion of that value as price
3. Leave enough value with the customer to make the purchase obvious

**Example:**
Your software saves a customer 10 hours/week × $50/hour × 50 weeks = $25,000/year.
A price of $5,000/year captures 20% of the value — clear ROI for the customer, healthy margin for you.

**This is the default for operators.** Always start with value-based pricing if differentiation exists.

## The Economic Foundations of Pricing

### Marginal Cost and Marginal Revenue

**Marginal cost:** The cost of producing one more unit
**Marginal revenue:** The revenue from selling one more unit

**Optimal pricing:** Set price where marginal revenue = marginal cost

In practice, this means:
- Don't price below marginal cost (you lose money on each sale)
- Don't chase sales where marginal revenue is below marginal cost
- For digital products with near-zero marginal cost, pricing is almost entirely about demand and value

### Price Discrimination (Capturing More Value)

Customers have different willingness-to-pay. Charging everyone the same price leaves money on the table.

**First-degree (perfect):** Charge each customer their maximum willingness-to-pay.
- Rare in practice
- Enterprise sales with custom pricing approaches this

**Second-degree (quantity/versioning):** Offer different packages, let customers self-select.
- Tiered pricing (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
- Quantity discounts
- Feature-based segmentation

**Third-degree (segment-based):** Charge different prices to different groups.
- Student discounts
- Geographic pricing
- Industry-specific pricing

### The Demand Curve in Action

```
Price
  ↑
  |  ×
  |    ×
  |      ×
  |        ×
  |          ×
  └─────────────→ Quantity
```

Higher prices → fewer customers (but higher margin per customer)
Lower prices → more customers (but lower margin per customer)

The profit-maximizing point is rarely at the extremes.

## Pricing Structures

### Tiered Pricing

Create packages that segment customers by willingness-to-pay.

**Good tiers:**
- Have clear differentiation (not arbitrary feature removal)
- Align with customer segments (solo → team → enterprise)
- Guide most customers to the middle tier (the "anchor")

**Failure mode:** Too many tiers → confusion. Three is usually optimal for most businesses.

### Usage-Based Pricing

Charge based on consumption (API calls, data processed, users, transactions).

**When it works:**
- Value scales with usage
- Customers prefer variable costs to fixed
- You can track usage accurately

**When it fails:**
- Customers fear unpredictable bills
- Value doesn't scale with usage
- Tracking is unreliable or gameable

### Per-Seat Pricing

Charge per user or seat.

**Advantages:**
- Simple to understand
- Grows with customer organization
- Easy to benchmark

**Disadvantages:**
- Penalizes adoption (customers limit seats)
- May not reflect value (one power user vs. ten casual users)

### Value Metric Pricing

Tie price to the unit of value you create.

**Examples:**
- CRM priced per contact (value = customer relationships managed)
- Payment processor priced per transaction (value = payments processed)
- HR software priced per employee (value = employees managed)

This is the gold standard when you can identify the value metric clearly.

## Strategic Pricing Decisions

### When to Discount

**Discount when:**
- You're buying market share with eyes open (time-limited strategy)
- Marginal cost is low and you'd otherwise have idle capacity
- The customer has strategic value beyond revenue (reference, partner)
- You're testing price sensitivity

**Don't discount when:**
- You're already the cheapest
- Discounts will leak to other customers
- You're training customers to wait for discounts
- You can't afford the margin hit

### When to Hold the Line

- When your value proposition is clear
- When discounting would damage brand perception
- When the customer will buy anyway
- When you're capacity-constrained

### How to Raise Prices

1. **Grandfather existing customers** (optional but reduces churn)
2. **Communicate value** before communicating price
3. **Raise incrementally** (5-15% is often absorbable)
4. **Add new value** with the increase when possible
5. **Time it well** (not during customer crisis or contract negotiation)

### Anchor Pricing

The first price a customer sees shapes perception.

**Tactics:**
- Show the highest tier first (makes lower tiers seem reasonable)
- Show "was $X, now $Y" (anchors to higher price)
- Show per-unit comparisons that favor you

**Warning:** Don't anchor dishonestly. Fake "original prices" erode trust.

## Pricing Psychology

### Reference Prices

Customers compare your price to:
- What they paid before
- What competitors charge
- What substitutes cost
- Round numbers

If your price exceeds reference prices without clear justification, resistance increases.

### Price Thresholds

Certain prices feel different:
- $99 feels meaningfully cheaper than $100
- $9.99/month feels consumer; $10/month feels business
- Enterprise budgets often have approval thresholds ($10K, $50K, $100K)

Price just below thresholds when possible.

### The Compromise Effect

When given three options, people gravitate toward the middle.

Use this: Make your preferred tier the middle one.

### Framing

How you present price matters:
- "$1/day" feels cheaper than "$365/year"
- "Saves you $10K" beats "Costs $5K"
- "Pay annually, get 2 months free" feels better than "17% annual discount"

## Failure Modes

### 1. Cost-Based Thinking

"We need 30% margin, so we'll mark up costs by 30%."

This ignores willingness-to-pay. You might be pricing below what customers would pay, or above what the market will bear.

### 2. Leaving Segments Behind

One price for everyone means you're overpricing for some customers and underpricing for others. Segmentation captures more total value.

### 3. Discount Creep

Sales team gives 10% to close deals. Then 15%. Then 20%. Soon your pricing is a fiction.

**Fix:** Publish discount limits, require escalation, tie comp to margin not revenue.

### 4. Competing on Price When You Shouldn't

If you have differentiation, competing on price commoditizes you. Hold value position.

### 5. Ignoring Customer Perception

A price that's justified economically can still feel wrong. If customers don't understand the value, they won't pay the price.

## The Operator's Pricing Framework

1. **Start with value:** What's the economic value you create for customers?

2. **Segment customers:** Who's willing to pay more? Who's price-sensitive?

3. **Structure for capture:** Design tiers or pricing structures that let customers self-select.

4. **Set anchors strategically:** Guide perception with smart framing and presentation.

5. **Test and iterate:** Price is a hypothesis. Run experiments.

6. **Defend discipline:** Hold the line on discounts. Protect margins.

## Summary

Pricing is where strategy meets economics. Get it wrong, and you leave money on the table or lose sales you should have won.

Key principles:
- Value-based pricing beats cost-based pricing
- Different customers have different willingness-to-pay — segment to capture it
- Price structures (tiers, usage, per-seat) shape behavior
- Psychology matters — framing, anchors, and thresholds affect decisions
- Discount discipline protects margins
- Price is a lever — pull it with intention, not desperation
