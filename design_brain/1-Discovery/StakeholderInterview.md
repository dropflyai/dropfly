## Purpose

Stakeholder interviews exist to:
- uncover business goals and constraints

- surface hidden requirements
- align expectations before design begins

Stakeholders include: founders, product managers, engineers, customer success, sales, support.

## Interview Template

### Opening (2 min)
```
"Thank you for your time. I'm gathering input to ensure
the design reflects business needs. I'll ask questions,
take notes, and share a summary for your review.
There are no wrong answers — your perspective is valuable."
```

### Core Questions (25-35 min)
- Adapt based on role
- Follow interesting threads
- Ask "why" and "tell me more"
- Note contradictions

### Closing (5 min)
```
"What haven't I asked that I should know?"
"Who else should I talk to?"
"Can I follow up if questions arise?"
```

## Synthesis Process

### After All Interviews

1. **Compile Insights**
   - Group by theme
   - Note frequency of mentions
   - Identify consensus vs. conflict

2. **Identify Patterns**
   - What do all stakeholders agree on?
   - Where do they disagree?
   - What's unsaid but implied?

3. **Surface Tensions**
   - Goals that conflict
   - Resource constraints vs. ambition
   - User needs vs. business needs

4. **Create Alignment Document**
   - Shared understanding
   - Decisions needed
   - Open questions

## Red Flags to Watch For

### During Interviews
- No clear success metrics
- Conflicting definitions of the user
- "Just make it look good"
- No one owns the decision
- Unrealistic timelines
- "We'll figure it out later"

### After Interviews
- Stakeholders with opposing visions
- No one mentioned the user
- Success metrics are vanity metrics
- Scope keeps expanding
- No one knows the competition

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- Skipping stakeholder interviews
- Only talking to one person
- Taking requirements at face value
- Not documenting contradictions
- Designing before alignment
- Assuming you know the business

---

## Output Artifacts

After stakeholder interviews, you should have:
- [ ] Individual interview summaries
- [ ] Stakeholder alignment summary
- [ ] List of open questions
- [ ] Identified tensions/conflicts
- [ ] Success criteria (in stakeholder words)
- [ ] Constraints list
- [ ] Decision log
