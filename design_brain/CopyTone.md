# Copy Tone & Language — Authoritative

This document defines how interface language must sound.
Copy exists to reduce uncertainty and guide action, not to market or impress.

If copy feels generic, vague, or promotional, it has failed.

---

## CORE TONE PRINCIPLES

Interface copy must be:
- Direct
- Calm
- Human
- Neutral
- Confidence-through-clarity

Avoid sounding:
- Salesy
- Hype-driven
- Corporate
- Cute
- Robotic

---

## DEFAULT VOICE

- Short sentences
- Plain language
- Active voice
- Concrete verbs
- No metaphors

The interface speaks like a competent teammate, not a brand campaign.

---

## WHAT TO SAY (AND WHAT NOT TO)

### GOOD
- "Create a new workflow"
- "Retry the failed step"
- "No runs yet"
- "This action can't be undone"
- "Something went wrong. Check the logs and try again."

### BAD (DISALLOWED)
- "Unlock powerful automation"
- "Supercharge your productivity"
- "Oops! Something magical happened"
- "Level up your experience"
- "Let's get started!"

If copy sounds like marketing, rewrite it.

---

## BUTTON COPY RULES

- Buttons describe the action, not the outcome
- Use verbs
- Avoid generic labels

### GOOD
- "Create project"
- "Save changes"
- "Run agent"
- "Delete workflow"

### BAD
- "Submit"
- "Confirm"
- "OK"
- "Continue" (without context)

---

## EMPTY STATE COPY

Empty states must explain:
1. What this area is
2. Why it matters
3. What to do next

### Example
**No workflows yet**
Workflows automate multi-step tasks.
Create one to get started.

Avoid:
- Jokes
- Emojis
- Over-encouragement

---

## ERROR COPY

Error messages must:
- State what happened
- Indicate impact (if relevant)
- Suggest next steps

### GOOD
"Run failed at step 3. The API timed out. You can retry or edit the configuration."

### BAD
"Something went wrong."

Never blame the user.

---

## SUCCESS COPY

- Acknowledge completion briefly
- Avoid celebration
- Avoid exclamation points

### GOOD
"Workflow saved."

### BAD
"Success! 🎉 Your workflow is ready to go!"

---

## AGENTIC UI COPY (SPECIAL RULES)

For MODE_AGENTIC interfaces:
- Prefer factual language
- Show timestamps, states, and reasons
- Avoid anthropomorphism
- Avoid "thinking", "deciding", "feeling"

### GOOD
"Agent paused due to missing credentials."

### BAD
"The agent is thinking about what to do next."

---

## CONFIRMATION & DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS

- Be explicit
- State consequences clearly
- Avoid fear language

### GOOD
"Delete workflow?
This will remove the workflow and its run history."

### BAD
"Are you sure you want to do this?"

---

## MICROCOPY

Use microcopy to:
- Reduce uncertainty
- Explain constraints
- Prevent errors

Place microcopy:
- Below inputs
- Near irreversible actions
- Near complex configuration options

---

## LANGUAGE CONSISTENCY

- Use the same term for the same thing everywhere
- Do not alternate synonyms
- Prefer clarity over variety

If a term is introduced, it must be used consistently.

---

## FINAL COPY CHECK

Before shipping, ask:
- Would a human product designer write this?
- Is every word doing work?
- Can any word be removed without loss of meaning?

If yes, remove it.
