# Deep Research Framework — Authoritative

Interviews tell you what users say.
Deep research tells you what they don't know to say.

---

## Purpose

Deep research exists to:
- build comprehensive market understanding
- validate stakeholder assumptions with data
- inform persona development with real demographics
- discover unspoken user needs and behaviors
- ground design decisions in evidence

Interviews alone leave blind spots. Deep research fills them.

## Research Process Overview

### Phase 1: Scoping (1-2 hours)

Based on stakeholder interviews, define:

```
RESEARCH SCOPE

TARGET INDUSTRY:
_______________

TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC:
_______________

GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS:
_______________

KEY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

ASSUMPTIONS TO VALIDATE:
1.
2.
3.

```

### Phase 2: Intelligence Gathering (4-8 hours)

Execute research across all four areas:

```
| Area | Time | Priority | Owner |
|------|------|----------|-------|
| Industry Intelligence | 2 hrs | High | |
| Demographic Analysis | 2 hrs | High | |
| Design Intelligence | 2 hrs | Medium | |
| Market Research | 2 hrs | High | |
```

### Phase 3: Synthesis (2-4 hours)

Consolidate findings into actionable insights:

```
SYNTHESIS OUTPUTS:
[ ] Industry context summary
[ ] Target user profile (data-backed)
[ ] Design direction recommendations

## Research to Design Connection

### How Research Informs Design

```
RESEARCH FINDING → DESIGN DECISION

Industry is highly regulated
→ Include compliance messaging, security visuals

Target users are time-starved executives
→ Prioritize speed, minimize clicks, executive summary views

Competitors all use blue
→ Differentiate with alternative color (if trust allows)

Users make decisions by committee
→ Include sharing, export, presentation features

Mobile usage is 60%+
→ Mobile-first design approach

Users distrust new tools
→ Strong social proof, testimonials, security messaging
```

---

## Quality Checklist

### Before Accepting Research

- [ ] Multiple sources corroborate findings
- [ ] Data is recent (within 1-2 years)
- [ ] Sources are credible
- [ ] Assumptions are explicitly validated
- [ ] Design implications are documented
- [ ] Interview questions are updated

### Red Flags

- Single source for major finding
- Outdated data (>3 years)
- Confirmation bias (only finding what you expect)
- No contradictory evidence considered
- Research without design implications

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- Skipping research because "we know the market"
- Research paralysis (endless gathering, no synthesis)
- Cherry-picking data that confirms assumptions
- Ignoring contradictory evidence
- Not connecting research to design decisions
- Treating research as one-time activity

---

## Output Artifacts

After deep research, you should have:
- [ ] Completed Industry Intelligence document
- [ ] Completed Demographic Analysis document
- [ ] Completed Design Intelligence document
- [ ] Completed Market Research document
- [ ] Consolidated Deep Research Report
- [ ] Updated interview questions
- [ ] Design direction recommendations
