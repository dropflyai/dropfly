# Persona Template — Authoritative

Personas are not demographics. They are decision-making tools.
A persona without behavioral insights is useless.

---

## Purpose

Personas exist to:
- make the abstract "user" concrete
- guide design decisions
- create team alignment
- prevent "designing for everyone"
- keep user needs visible

A good persona answers: "Would [Name] do this?"

---

## Persona Types

### Primary Persona
The main user your product is designed for.
- Design MUST work for them
- Features prioritized for their needs
- Usually 1, sometimes 2

### Secondary Persona
Important users with additional needs.
- Design should accommodate them
- Needs met without compromising primary
- Usually 1-3

### Anti-Persona
Who we are NOT designing for.
- Explicitly excluded
- Prevents scope creep
- Usually 1-2

---

## Research-Based Personas

### Required Evidence
Personas MUST be based on:
- User interviews (minimum 5-8)
- Behavioral data / analytics
- Support ticket analysis
- Sales call patterns

### Not Acceptable
- Assumptions
- Stakeholder opinions
- Market research alone
- Demographic profiles

## Anti-Persona Example

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PERSONA NAME: Developer Dave
TYPE: [ ] Primary  [ ] Secondary  [x] Anti-Persona
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

QUICK SUMMARY
"Software engineer who prefers writing code to using no-code tools"

WHY ANTI-PERSONA
- Would rather build custom solution
- Finds no-code limiting
- Not our target market
- Designing for them would harm primary persona

WHAT THIS MEANS
- Don't add "code mode" to satisfy developers
- Don't expose technical complexity
- Don't use developer terminology
- Marketing should not target this audience
```

## Persona Validation Checklist

Before using a persona:

- [ ] Based on real research (5+ interviews)
- [ ] Behaviors documented, not just demographics
- [ ] Goals are actionable for design
- [ ] Frustrations are specific
- [ ] Quotes are real (from research)
- [ ] Design implications are clear
- [ ] Team has reviewed and agreed
- [ ] Anti-personas defined

---

## Using Personas in Design

### During Design Reviews
```
"Would [Persona Name] understand this?"
"Does this solve [Persona Name]'s primary goal?"
"Would this frustrate [Persona Name]?"
```

### For Prioritization
```
| Feature | Primary Persona | Secondary | Anti-Persona |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
|         | Must/Nice/Don't | Must/Nice | Would want?  |
```

### For Conflict Resolution
When stakeholders disagree:
"What would [Primary Persona] choose?"

---

## Keeping Personas Alive

### Visibility
- Print and post in workspace
- Include in design documents
- Reference in meetings

### Updates
- Review quarterly
- Update with new research
- Retire outdated personas

### Accountability
- Assign persona owner
- Track usage in design process
- Measure against real user behavior

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- Too many personas (>4)
- Demographics without behaviors
- Personas no one references
- Stakeholder-as-persona
- "Everyone" persona
- Personas without quotes
- Personas without design implications

---
