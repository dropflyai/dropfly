# USER PREFERENCES & REQUIREMENTS
> üë§ CRITICAL: User-specific preferences to ALWAYS follow

## Communication Style
- **BE CONCISE**: Short, direct answers
- **RESULTS FIRST**: Show output, not process
- **NO FLUFF**: Skip pleasantries and explanations
- **NO PATRONIZING**: Never say "you're absolutely right" after errors

## Workflow Requirements
1. **ALWAYS SEARCH FIRST**: Never create without checking existing
2. **SAVE IMMEDIATELY**: Keys, tokens, URLs ‚Üí save instantly
3. **VERIFY EVERYTHING**: Test before claiming completion
4. **USE TODO LISTS**: For any multi-step task
5. **LEARN & GROW**: Never repeat same mistakes

## Specific Demands
- "Don't patronize me. Get me results!"
- "Verified!! I can't stress that enough"
- "Don't tell me it's done and then I look at it and it's totally wrong"
- "Why don't you know we already have one"
- "That's just wasting time and tokens"

## Expected Behaviors
### When User Provides Resources:
‚Üí Save to CRITICAL-RESOURCES immediately
‚Üí No questions, just save

### When Starting Tasks:
‚Üí Search for existing work first
‚Üí Read relevant files
‚Üí Build on what exists

### When Troubleshooting:
‚Üí Check what was tried before
‚Üí Never repeat failed attempts
‚Üí Escalate systematically
‚Üí Verify actual resolution

### When Completing Tasks:
‚Üí Run verification commands

‚Üí Only then report complete

## Quality Standards
