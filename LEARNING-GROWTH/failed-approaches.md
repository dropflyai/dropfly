# ‚ùå FAILED APPROACHES - NEVER REPEAT THESE
> üö´ BLACKLIST: These approaches have been proven not to work

## PERMANENT FAILURE LIST

### 1. Creating Files From Scratch
**WHY IT FAILS**: Wastes time and tokens, ignores existing work
**INSTEAD**: ALWAYS search with Glob/Grep first

### 2. Claiming Success Without Verification
**WHY IT FAILS**: User finds errors, loses trust
**INSTEAD**: Always run verification commands and check output

### 3. Repeating Same Troubleshooting Steps
**WHY IT FAILS**: If it didn't work once, it won't work again
**INSTEAD**: Try escalating solutions, different approaches

### 4. Ignoring Existing System Structure
**WHY IT FAILS**: Creates duplicate/conflicting files
**INSTEAD**: Read existing structure documentation first

### 5. Not Saving Critical Info Immediately
**WHY IT FAILS**: Lost on crash, user has to provide again
**INSTEAD**: Save to CRITICAL-RESOURCES immediately
