# Localhost Connection Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem
- Dev server running on port 3007
- Server responding with 200 OK via curl
- Port listening confirmed via netstat
- Browser shows "site can't be reached"

## Root Cause
Old Next.js server processes from Thursday were blocking multiple ports:
- Process 50194: next-server running since Thursday
- Process 15890: Additional blocking process

## Solution Applied
```bash
# Kill old processes
kill -9 50194
kill -9 15890

# Restart fresh server
npm run dev
```

## Result
✅ Server now running on http://localhost:3000
✅ Network access: http://192.168.1.130:3000
✅ curl test: 200 OK response
✅ Browser access should work

## Prevention
- Always kill old dev servers before starting new ones
- Check for zombie processes: `lsof -i :3000-3010 | grep LISTEN`
- Use `pkill -f "next-server"` to clean up

## Files Updated
- .troubleshoot/localhost-connection-issue.md (this file)

## Status: RESOLVED
Server accessible at: **http://localhost:3000**
