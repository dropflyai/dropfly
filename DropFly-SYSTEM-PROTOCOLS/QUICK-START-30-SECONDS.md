# âš¡ 30-Second Quick Start

## Right Now - Do This First

### 1. Setup (10 seconds)
```bash
cd ~/Documents/OS-App-Builder
chmod +x *.sh
echo 'alias dev="~/Documents/OS-App-Builder/dev.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 2. Test It Works (10 seconds)
```bash
dev status    # See your dashboard
dev check     # Get health score
```

### 3. First Win (10 seconds)
```bash
dev save "my first save"    # Save current state
dev gen component Button   # Generate some code
```

## âœ… You're Done!

**If those 3 steps worked, you now have:**
- âœ… Command center running (`dev status`)
- âœ… Auto-save protection available
- âœ… Code generation working
- âœ… Version control system active
- âœ… Health monitoring enabled
- âœ… Deployment pipeline ready

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

**Today:**
1. Use `dev save "message"` every time something works
2. Use `dev gen [type] [name]` instead of writing boilerplate
3. Use `dev status` to see what's happening

**This Week:**
1. Start every coding session with `./auto-commit.sh &`
2. Use `dev check` before any deployment
3. Use `dev rollback` when things break

**This Month:**
1. Read the full MASTERY-GUIDE.md
2. Customize scripts for your workflow
3. Teach someone else to use it

**The #1 Rule: If something works, save it immediately with `dev save "what works"`**

Never lose good work again. ðŸŽ¯
