## Day 1: Setup & First Win

### 🚀 Initial Setup (10 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Make all scripts globally accessible
cd ~/Documents/OS-App-Builder
chmod +x *.sh

# 2. Add aliases to your shell (choose your shell)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/Documents/OS-App-Builder:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'alias dev="~/Documents/OS-App-Builder/dev.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# 3. Test the setup
dev status
```

### ✅ First Win - Save Your First Version
```bash
# Start with a clean state
dev status

# Make a small change to any file
echo "# Test" >> README.md

# Save your first version
dev save "my first version save"

# See what happened
git log --oneline -5
ls versions-archive/
```

**🎉 Success Indicator:** You should see:
- A new git tag (v3.0-my-first-version-save)
- A backup branch created
- An archive in versions-archive/
- Updated VERSIONS.md file

## Week 1: Build Muscle Memory

### 🏃‍♂️ Daily Practice Routine

#### Morning Ritual (3 minutes)
```bash
# Every morning, start with:
dev status          # See where you are
dev check          # Health check your project
./auto-commit.sh & # Start auto-save protection

# If working on something risky:
dev save "before starting today's work"
```

#### Core Commands to Master
Practice these until they're automatic:

```bash
# The Big 5 - Use these every day
dev status         # Check everything
dev save "msg"     # Save good states
dev gen component MyComponent  # Generate code
dev deploy preview # Deploy for testing
dev check         # Health check

# The Essential 3 - Multiple times per day
dev s "quick save"    # (s = shortcut for save)
dev g page dashboard  # (g = shortcut for gen)
dev d staging        # (d = shortcut for deploy)
```

### 📝 Week 1 Challenges
**Complete these to build muscle memory:**

#### Challenge 1: The Speed Run
Time yourself doing this workflow:
```bash
# Target: Under 2 minutes
dev save "challenge start"
dev gen component TestButton
dev gen page test
dev gen api test/data
dev save "challenge complete"
dev rollback  # Pick the first version
```

#### Challenge 2: The Recovery Test
```bash
# Simulate a disaster
echo "BROKEN CODE" > src/app/page.tsx
# Oh no! How fast can you recover?
dev rollback
# Select your last good version
```

#### Challenge 3: The Health Monitor
```bash
# Run health check and fix all issues
dev check
# Fix any red/yellow items
# Run again until score > 90
```

## Week 2: Advanced Workflows

### 🎭 Demo Branch Mastery
Learn to create isolated demos for different audiences:

```bash
# Client wants to see payment features only
dev save "before client demo prep"
./create-demo.sh "client-payment-demo"
# Now modify this branch for client
# Remove features they shouldn't see
# Polish what they should see

# Investor wants to see analytics
git checkout main
./create-demo.sh "investor-analytics-demo"
# Customize for investor audience

# Internal team wants latest features
git checkout main
./create-demo.sh "internal-bleeding-edge"
```

### 🔄 Context Switching Like a Pro
```bash
# Working on Project A
dev save "switching to project B"
cd ../project-b
dev status  # See where you left off
# Continue work...

# Back to Project A later
cd ../project-a
cat SESSION-STATE.md  # Remember where you were
git log --oneline -5  # See recent work
```

### 🎯 Advanced Generation Patterns
```bash
# Generate full feature sets
dev gen component UserCard
dev gen hook useUser
dev gen context UserContext
dev gen store userStore
dev gen api users/profile
dev gen page users/profile

# Generate with patterns
dev gen component Modal       # Base modal
dev gen component AlertModal  # Specialized modal
dev gen component ConfirmModal
```

## Week 3: Automation & Optimization

### 🤖 Custom Automation Scripts
Create your own productivity scripts:

```bash
# Create a "feature" script
cat > feature.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Generate complete feature with all parts
FEATURE=$1
./dev.sh gen component ${FEATURE}Component
./dev.sh gen hook use${FEATURE}
./dev.sh gen api ${FEATURE,,}/crud
./dev.sh gen page ${FEATURE,,}
./dev.sh save "Generated complete $FEATURE feature"
echo "✅ Complete $FEATURE feature generated!"
EOF
chmod +x feature.sh

# Usage:
./feature.sh User
./feature.sh Payment
./feature.sh Analytics
```

### ⚡ Performance Optimization Workflow
```bash
# Weekly optimization routine
dev check                    # Get health baseline
npm run build               # Check bundle size
dev save "before optimization"

# Optimize based on health report
# Then verify improvements
dev check                   # New health score
npm run build              # New bundle size
dev save "after optimization - score improved"
```

### 🔍 Advanced Monitoring
```bash
# Set up monitoring dashboard
# Run this in a separate terminal
while true; do
  clear
  dev status
  echo "====== PERFORMANCE ======"
  echo "Bundle size: $(du -sh .next 2>/dev/null | cut -f1)"
  echo "Health: $(grep 'Score:' HEALTH-REPORT.md 2>/dev/null | tail -1)"
  sleep 30
done
```

## Daily Workflows

### 🌅 Morning Startup (2 minutes)
```bash
# The Perfect Developer Morning
cd ~/projects/current-project
dev status              # Where am I?
./auto-commit.sh &     # Protection on
dev check              # Any issues?
dev start              # Everything running
```

### 🌙 Evening Shutdown (1 minute)
```bash
# The Perfect Developer Evening  
dev save "end of day - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
dev check              # Health score for tomorrow
git push               # Sync to remote
dev stop               # Clean shutdown
```

### 🔥 Feature Development Flow
```bash
# Starting new feature
dev save "before $FEATURE_NAME feature"

# Generate boilerplate
dev gen component $FEATURE_NAME
dev gen hook use$FEATURE_NAME
dev gen api $FEATURE_NAME

# Develop...
# Test...

# Save working state
dev save "$FEATURE_NAME feature working"

# Deploy to staging
dev deploy staging

# Production ready?
dev check              # Must be >90 score
dev deploy production
```

### 🚨 Bug Fix Flow
```bash
# Bug reported!
dev save "before bug fix - $(date)"

# Quick health check
dev check

# Fix the bug...

# Verify fix works
npm run build
npm run test

# Deploy fix
dev save "bug fixed - issue #123"
dev deploy production
```

## Emergency Protocols

### 🔴 Code Broke - Can't Figure Out Why
```bash
# Emergency Recovery Protocol
./quick-rollback.sh     # Get menu of restore points
# Pick last working version
npm install             # Reinstall dependencies
npm run dev             # Test it works
# Now debug from known good state
```

### 🔴 Deployment Failed
```bash
# Deployment Failure Protocol
dev rollback           # Restore previous version
dev check             # What's wrong?
# Fix issues shown in health check
dev deploy staging    # Test fix
dev deploy production # Retry production
```

### 🔴 Lost Work (VS Code Crashed)
```bash
# Work Recovery Protocol
cat SESSION-STATE.md   # See where you were
git log --oneline -10  # See auto-commits
git status            # What's uncommitted?
# Your auto-save system saved you!
```

### 🔴 Demo Day Disaster
```bash
# Demo Disaster Recovery
git branch -a | grep demo/  # Find demo branches
git checkout demo/client-presentation-20240115
npm install
npm run dev
# Your demo branches are frozen in time!
```

## Pro Tips & Shortcuts

### ⚡ Speed Hacks
```bash
# Ultra-fast aliases (add to ~/.zshrc)
alias ds='dev status'
alias dc='dev check' 
alias dg='dev gen'
alias dd='dev deploy'
alias dsave='dev save'

# One-letter commands for fastest actions
alias s='dev save'
alias c='dev check'
alias g='dev gen'
alias d='dev deploy'

# Compound commands
alias morning='dev status && dev check && ./auto-commit.sh &'
alias evening='dev save "end of day" && dev check && git push'
```

### 🎯 Workflow Patterns

#### The "Golden State" Pattern
```bash
# When something works perfectly
dev save "golden state - auth system complete"
# Mark it as a recovery point
```

#### The "Checkpoint" Pattern
```bash
# Before any risky change
dev save "checkpoint before refactor"
# Make risky changes
# If it works:
dev save "refactor successful"
# If it breaks:
dev rollback  # Select checkpoint
```

#### The "Feature Branch" Pattern
```bash
# Working on big feature
git checkout -b feature/payments
dev gen component PaymentForm
dev gen api payments/process
# ... build feature ...
dev save "payments feature complete"
git checkout main
git merge feature/payments
```

### 🧠 Mental Models

#### The "Time Machine" Mindset
- Every `dev save` is a time machine checkpoint
- You can always go back to any good state
- Experiment fearlessly knowing you can recover

#### The "Assembly Line" Mindset
- Use code generation for all boilerplate
- Focus your brain on business logic only
- Let automation handle the repetitive stuff

#### The "Ship Captain" Mindset
- Run `dev check` like a ship's instrument check
- Keep your "health score" above 90
- Deploy with confidence when green
