```bash
# Search for existing project structure:
Glob: **/*PROJECT*
Glob: **/*README*
Glob: **/*CLAUDE*
Glob: **/package.json
Glob: **/*.md

# Read key files:
Read: [project-root]/CLAUDE.md (if exists)
Read: [project-root]/README.md (if exists)
Read: [project-root]/package.json (if exists)
```

#### 2. ENVIRONMENT SETUP CHECK
```bash
# Check development environment:
ls -la [project-root]
cat [project-root]/.env.example (if exists)
npm list (if Node.js project)
git status (if Git repo)
```

#### 3. CREATE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
If no CLAUDE.md exists, create with this template:
```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: [Name]
**Type**: [Description]
**Stack**: [Technologies]

## Development Commands
- Install: npm install
- Start: npm run dev
- Build: npm run build

## Current Status
[Current state]

## Recent Changes
[What was last worked on]
```

### üîÑ CONTINUING EXISTING PROJECT

#### 1. SESSION RESTORE (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Always check these files first:
Read: [project]/SESSION-MEMORY.md
Read: [project]/CLAUDE.md
Read: CRASH-RECOVERY/last-known-good-state.md
Read: TROUBLESHOOTING-LOG/active-issues.md
```

#### 2. VERIFY PROJECT STATE
```bash
# Check if project is working:
cd [project-directory]
npm run dev (or equivalent)
lsof -i :[port] # Check if running
curl -I http://localhost:[port] # Test if accessible
```

#### 3. UPDATE CHECKPOINT
```bash
# Save current state to crash recovery:
echo "## Checkpoint $(date)
Working on: [current task]
Project status: [status]
Last working command: [command]" >> CRASH-RECOVERY/last-known-good-state.md
```

### üêõ WHEN STUCK OR TROUBLESHOOTING

#### 1. CHECK LEARNING SYSTEM (FIRST!)
```bash
Read: LEARNING-GROWTH/failed-approaches.md
# DO NOT repeat anything in this file!

Read: LEARNING-GROWTH/successful-patterns.md  
# Look for similar solutions that worked

Read: TROUBLESHOOTING-LOG/active-issues.md
# Check if this issue is already being tracked
```

#### 2. LOG THE ISSUE
```bash
# Add to active issues immediately:
echo "## üî¥ HIGH Issue: [problem description]
**Started**: $(date)
**Error**: [exact error message]
**Attempts So Far**: None yet
**Next Steps**: 
- [ ] [first approach to try]" >> TROUBLESHOOTING-LOG/active-issues.md
```

#### 3. SYSTEMATIC TROUBLESHOOTING
```bash
# Level 1: Basic checks
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run type-check

# Level 2: Clean and restart
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run dev

# Level 3: Environment check
printenv | grep NODE
cat .env.local
git status

# Document each attempt in active-issues.md
```

### üíæ WHEN MAKING CHANGES

#### 1. BEFORE CHANGING CODE
```bash
# Always read existing code first:
Read: [file-to-modify]

# Check patterns in similar files:
Glob: **/*[similar-pattern]*
Read: [similar files for patterns]
```

#### 2. DURING CHANGES
```bash
# Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks:
TodoWrite: [list of steps]

# Update SESSION-MEMORY.md with changes:
echo "## Changes $(date)
Modified: [file]:[line-numbers]
Purpose: [what and why]" >> [project]/SESSION-MEMORY.md
```

#### 3. AFTER CHANGES
```bash
# ALWAYS verify changes work:
npm run build
npm run lint  
npm run type-check
curl -I http://localhost:[port] # Test if working

# Only mark TodoWrite complete AFTER verification
```

## üîß DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW

### BEFORE DEPLOYMENT
```bash
# Run comprehensive checks:
./scripts/backup-deployment.sh

# This will:
# 1. Create version backup
# 2. Tag in Git  
# 3. Deploy to Vercel
# 4. Save all URLs
# 5. Create rollback instructions
```

### AFTER DEPLOYMENT
```bash
# Update tracking:
echo "## Deployed $(date)
Version: [version-tag]  
URL: [production-url]
Status: ‚úÖ Live" >> DEPLOYED-VERSIONS/deployment-log.md

# Test live deployment:
curl -I [production-url]
```

## üìä COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

### USER INTERACTION RULES
1. **BE CONCISE**: Max 4 lines unless asked for detail
2. **RESULTS FIRST**: Show command output, not explanation
3. **NO PATRONIZING**: Never say "you're absolutely right" after errors
4. **VERIFY EVERYTHING**: Test before claiming completion

### WHEN USER PROVIDES RESOURCES
```bash
# SAVE IMMEDIATELY without asking:
echo "[resource]" >> CRITICAL-RESOURCES/[appropriate-file].md
echo "‚úÖ Saved to CRITICAL-RESOURCES"
```

### WHEN REPORTING COMPLETION
```bash
# NEVER say "done" without verification:
# 1. Run actual test
