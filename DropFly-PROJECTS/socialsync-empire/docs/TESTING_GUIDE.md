- May need to retry generation

### Ads not appearing in Airtable

## üìà Next Steps After Testing

Once you've verified the system works:

1. **Generate a content mix:**
   - 10 educational posts (üìö Educational button)
   - 5 product ads (üéØ All Products button)
   - This gives you your 70/30 educational/advertising mix

2. **Review in Airtable:**
   - Educational content in "Posts" table
   - Product ads in "Product Ads" table
   - Approve/reject as needed

3. **Generate media:**
   - Use üé® Generate Media button for approved content
   - Note: Media generation currently only works for "Posts" table
   - Product ads media workflow needs to be added to n8n separately

4. **Publishing:**
   - Approved content in "Posts" table can be published now
   - Product ads will need separate publishing workflow (future enhancement)

**Best Practices:**
- Generate educational content in batches of 10
