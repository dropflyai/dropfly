# Natural Language Interface Specifications
## Chat with Your Accounting System Like a CFO

### OVERVIEW
The Natural Language Interface (NLI) transforms how legal professionals interact with their financial data. Instead of navigating complex menus and generating reports manually, users can simply ask questions in plain English and receive intelligent, contextual responses with supporting data and insights.

## CORE CAPABILITIES

### 1. CONVERSATIONAL FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE

#### Chat Interface Features

}
```

#### Conversation Flow Examples
```javascript
// Example 1: Cash Flow Analysis
USER: "How is our cash flow looking?"

  summary: "Your cash flow is strong this month with $47,300 net positive flow",
  details: {
    cash_in: "$156,800 (up 12% from last month)",
    cash_out: "$109,500 (down 3% from last month)", 
    net_flow: "$47,300 positive",
    trend: "improving_for_3_consecutive_months"
  },
  insights: [
    "Trust account receipts are 18% higher than usual",
    "Office expenses decreased due to remote work adoption",
    "Client payments are coming in 2.3 days faster on average"
  ],

    "Would you like to see the cash flow forecast for next quarter?",
    "Should I show you which clients are contributing most to this growth?",
    "Want to compare this to the same period last year?"
  ]
}

// Example 2: Trust Account Compliance
USER: "Are there any trust account issues I should know about?"

AI_RESPONSE: {
  compliance_status: "All trust accounts are compliant with 2 items requiring attention",
  summary: "No violations detected, but I found 2 optimization opportunities",
  details: {
    total_trust_accounts: 12,

    {
      type: "optimization",
      description: "Johnson case trust account has been idle for 45 days",
      recommendation: "Consider contacting client about case status",
      impact: "low"
    },
    {
      type: "efficiency", 
      description: "Wilson matter reconciliation is 3 days overdue",
      recommendation: "Reconcile today to maintain compliance schedule",
      impact: "medium"
    }
  ],
  proactive_insights: [
    "Trust account interest allocation is 99.7% accurate",
