# Trading Rules & Risk Management

**Read this document thoroughly before trading with real money.**

This system provides high-quality trading signals, but **your success depends on following these rules consistently.**

---

## Core Trading Philosophy

> "The best traders are disciplined losers. They know how to take small losses and let winners run."

**This system is designed for:**
- Scalping options with 10-15% gains
- 2-3 high-probability trades per day
- Target: $300/day profit
- Capital preservation first, profits second

---

## The 10 Commandments of Day Trading with This System

### 1. Trade Only HIGH-Quality Signals (Most Important)

**Rule:**
- Only enter trades rated **HIGH** by the AI
- Occasionally take strong **MEDIUM** signals (after 2+ weeks of experience)
- **NEVER** trade LOW-quality signals

**Why:**
- HIGH signals have 65-75% win rate
- MEDIUM signals have 50-60% win rate
- LOW signals have <50% win rate

**Exception:**
- After 1 month of tracking, if you find certain MEDIUM setups work well for you, you may add them selectively

### 2. Maximum 2-3 Trades Per Day

**Rule:**
- No more than 3 trades in a single day
- If you hit 2 losses, stop for the day
- If you hit $300 profit, consider stopping (optional)

**Why:**
- Overtrading kills accounts
- Mental fatigue leads to mistakes
- Quality over quantity

**Example Day:**
- Trade 1: +$150 (WIN)
- Trade 2: -$80 (LOSS)
- Trade 3: +$200 (WIN)
- **Result:** +$270, STOP for the day ✅

### 3. Strict Position Sizing

**Rule:**
- **Minimum per trade:** $800
- **Maximum per trade:** $1,500
- **Never risk more than you can afford to lose**

**Position Size by Account Size:**

| Account Size | Per Trade | Max Risk |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| $5,000 | $800-$1,000 | $70-$100 |
| $10,000 | $1,000-$1,500 | $100-$150 |
| $25,000+ | $1,500-$2,000 | $150-$200 |

**Why:**
- Prevents catastrophic losses
- Allows for multiple trades
- Keeps emotional control

### 4. Hard Stop Loss: -7%

**Rule:**
- Set stop loss IMMEDIATELY when entering trade
- Stop loss = -7% maximum
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**
- If hit, exit immediately

**Stop Loss Placement:**

**For LONG/CALL trades:**
- Below VWAP (typically 1-2%)
- Below recent support
- Maximum: -7% from entry

**For PUT/SHORT trades:**
- Above VWAP (typically 1-2%)
- Above recent resistance
- Maximum: -7% from entry

**Example:**
- Entry: $1,000 position
- Stop loss at -7%: Exit at -$70 loss
- Actual stop should be tighter (at VWAP), usually -2-3%

**Mental Stop vs. Hard Stop:**
- ✅ Set **hard stop** in your broker (alerts at minimum)
- ❌ Don't rely on "mental stops" - emotions will betray you

### 5. Take Profit: +10% to +15%

**Rule:**
- Target: +10-15% on options
- Consider scaling out: 50% at +10%, let 50% run to +15%
- Don't be greedy - take profits

**Taking Profits:**

**Conservative (Recommended First Month):**
- Exit 100% at +10-12%
- Lock in gains, move on

**Moderate:**
- Exit 50% at +10%
- Let 50% run to +15%
- Move stop to breakeven on remaining position

**Aggressive (Only After 2+ Months Success):**
- Exit 33% at +10%
- Exit 33% at +15%
- Let 33% run with trailing stop

**Why:**
- Options can reverse quickly
- 10-15% compounded daily = massive returns
- Greed kills accounts

### 6. Maximum Daily Loss: $200

**Rule:**
- If you lose $200 in a single day, **STOP TRADING**
- Close platform, walk away
- Do NOT try to "make it back"
- Review trades, come back tomorrow

**Why:**
- Prevents revenge trading
- Protects capital
- Keeps emotions in check

**Example:**
- Trade 1: -$80
- Trade 2: -$120
- **Total:** -$200, **STOP** ❌

Do NOT take trade 3 to try to recover.

### 7. Trade Only During Optimal Hours

**Rule:**
- **Best hours:** 9:30-11:30 AM ET (first 2 hours)
- **Good hours:** 2:00-4:00 PM ET (power hour)
- **Avoid:** 11:30 AM-2:00 PM (lunch, low volume)

**Why:**
- Highest volume = clearer signals
- Most institutional activity = better trends
- Lunch hour = choppy, unpredictable

**Signal Priority by Time:**

| Time | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 9:30-10:00 AM | 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 | Opening Range plays, highest priority |
| 10:00-11:30 AM | 🌟🌟🌟🌟 | Continuation moves, very good |
| 11:30 AM-2:00 PM | 🌟🌟 | Choppy, avoid unless perfect setup |
| 2:00-4:00 PM | 🌟🌟🌟 | Power hour, good momentum |

### 8. Verify Setup Before Entry

**Rule:**
- When you receive a signal, **VERIFY** it manually
- Pull up the chart
- Confirm the setup looks clean
- Check volume
- Trust your eyes + AI evaluation

**Pre-Entry Checklist:**

1. ✅ AI rated as HIGH quality
2. ✅ Volume spike present on chart
3. ✅ Price is in correct position vs VWAP
4. ✅ EMAs aligned correctly
5. ✅ No conflicting signals
6. ✅ Clean candle structure
7. ✅ Within optimal trading hours

**If ALL boxes not checked → SKIP THE TRADE**

**Remember:** The system sends signals. You make the final decision.

### 9. Keep a Trading Journal

**Rule:**
- Record EVERY trade
- Note entry, exit, profit/loss
- Write what you did right/wrong
- Review weekly

**Minimum Journal Entries:**
- Date/Time
- Ticker
- Signal type
- AI quality rating
- Entry price
- Exit price
- P&L ($)
- P&L (%)
- Notes (what worked, what didn't)

**Why:**
- Identify patterns
- Learn from mistakes
- Track actual vs. expected performance
- Improve over time

**Template:**

```
Date: 2025-11-25
Time: 9:45 AM ET
Ticker: NVDA
Signal: VWAP_RECLAIM_LONG
AI Quality: HIGH
Entry: $188.20
Exit: $210.50 (options +12%)
Position Size: $1,000
P&L: +$120
Notes: Perfect setup, clean reclaim, strong volume.
       Exited at +12% per rules. Great trade.
```

### 10. No Revenge Trading (Critical)

**Rule:**
- **Never** try to "make back" a loss immediately
- Take losses in stride
- Move on to the next signal
- If emotional, stop trading for the day

**Revenge Trading Signs:**
- "I need to make that money back NOW"
- Taking lower-quality signals out of desperation
- Increasing position size after a loss
- Trading outside your plan

**If you feel ANY of these → STOP TRADING**

**Better Approach:**
- Accept the loss
- Review what went wrong
- Learn from it
- Come back tomorrow with a clear mind

## Risk Management Formula

### Position Sizing Formula

```
Position Size = Account Size × Risk Percentage / Stop Loss %

Example:
- Account: $10,000
- Risk per trade: 1% = $100
- Stop loss: -7%
- Position size: $10,000 × 1% / 7% = $1,428

Use $1,400 (within $800-$1,500 range)
```

### Kelly Criterion (Advanced)

Once you have 50+ trades tracked:

```
Kelly % = (Win Rate × Avg Win) - (Loss Rate × Avg Loss) / Avg Win

Example:
- Win rate: 65%
- Avg win: +12%
- Loss rate: 35%
- Avg loss: -4%

Kelly % = (0.65 × 12) - (0.35 × 4) / 12 = 0.53 / 12 = 4.4%

Recommended: Use 1/4 Kelly = 1.1% per trade
```

### Risk of Ruin

With these rules, your risk of ruin (losing entire account) is <1%:

- Max risk per trade: 7%
- Max daily loss: $200 (2% on $10K account)
- Win rate target: 65%
- Risk/Reward: 1:2 (risk 4%, target 12%)

**This is sustainable long-term trading.**

## When to Adjust the System

### Good Reasons to Adjust

1. **Consistent data over 50+ trades shows a pattern:**
   - Certain signals perform better
   - Certain tickers more reliable
   - Specific timeframes work better

2. **Market conditions change:**
   - Increased volatility → tighten stops
   - Decreased volatility → fewer signals (normal)

3. **Your performance improves:**
   - After 2-3 months success → add selective MEDIUM signals
   - After 6 months → consider position size increase

### Bad Reasons to Adjust

1. ❌ One bad day or week
2. ❌ Emotions (fear, greed, frustration)
3. ❌ "I think I know better" without data
4. ❌ Trying to "fix" normal variance
5. ❌ Impatience for results

**Rule:** Make changes based on DATA, not feelings.

3. **Acceptance:** Losses are part of the game
