## üöÄ PROJECT INITIALIZATION WORKFLOW

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: How to Start a New Project

**When user says "let's start a new project" or "create a new app", follow this EXACT sequence:**

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering
**MANDATORY: Ask questions ONE AT A TIME until complete information gathered:**

**üî¥ STOP - Do NOT proceed until ALL questions answered**

1. **Business Information** (Ask one by one)
   - What is the business/client name?
   - What type of business is it? (restaurant, retail, service, etc.)
   - What is the main goal of this project? (demo site, full website, specific features?)

2. **Technical Requirements** (Ask one by one)
   - Do they have an existing website or online presence to research?
   - What are the key features they need? (AI chat, voice agent, e-commerce, etc.)
   - What is their brand colors/aesthetic preference?

3. **Project Scope** (Ask one by one)
   - Who is their target audience?
   - What is the timeline/priority level?
   - What is the budget/complexity level?

**‚úÖ ONLY proceed to Phase 2 when ALL requirements are documented**

### Phase 2: Backend Framework Implementation
**MANDATORY - Use `PROJECT-INITIALIZATION-PROMPTS.md`:**

1. Database schema with 15+ tables
2. Row Level Security on every table
3. Performance indexes
4. Edge Functions for business logic
5. Monitoring and alerting
6. Complete documentation

### Phase 3: Project Setup & Logging Infrastructure
**üî¥ MANDATORY: Set up complete logging system BEFORE any development**

1. **Create project folder with standard structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir project-name
   cd project-name
   mkdir .logs .docs .research .assets .credentials .troubleshoot .progress
   ```

2. **Initialize comprehensive logging system**
   ```bash
   # Create initial session log
   touch .logs/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-project-initialization.md
   
   # Create SESSION-MEMORY.md
   touch SESSION-MEMORY.md
   
   # Create project-specific CLAUDE.md
   touch CLAUDE.md
   ```

3. **üî• CRITICAL: Start logging IMMEDIATELY**
   - Log EVERY decision in `.logs/YYYY-MM-DD-session.md`
   - Log EVERY major update in `.progress/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Log EVERY issue in `.troubleshoot/issue-XXX.md`
   - Update SESSION-MEMORY.md after EVERY major task

4. **Initialize Git repository and credentials**
   ```bash
   git init
   echo ".credentials/" >> .gitignore
   echo ".env*" >> .gitignore
   ```

5. **Set up credentials management structure**

### Phase 4: Development & Documentation 
**üî• CONTINUOUS LOGGING REQUIRED - Log before, during, and after every action**

1. **Create comprehensive action plan** ‚Üí Log in `.docs/action-plan.md`
2. **Create detailed todo list** ‚Üí Track in SESSION-MEMORY.md
3. **Build project knowledge base** ‚Üí Save all research in `.research/`
4. **Implement with continuous logging** ‚Üí Every change logged
5. **Test and verify all functionality** ‚Üí Results logged in `.progress/`

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER work without logging - if it's not logged, it didn't happen**

## üìã SYSTEM PROMPTS & INITIALIZATION

### Critical Framework Files (Check These FIRST)
1. **STARTUP-REQUIREMENTS-FRAMEWORK.md** - Project planning and requirements
2. **ENTERPRISE-ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md** - Technical architecture decisions

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING PROTOCOL

### üö® WHEN USER SAYS "RUN TROUBLESHOOTING PROTOCOL"

**This triggers an UNSTOPPABLE debugging sequence that continues until solution found**

### Phase 1: Immediate Assessment & Action Plan
1. **STOP all other work** - troubleshooting is now priority #1
2. **CREATE troubleshooting session log** ‚Üí `.logs/YYYY-MM-DD-troubleshooting.md`
3. **DOCUMENT exact problem** with error messages, context, environment
4. **CREATE action plan** with systematic investigation steps
5. **SET "no-stop" commitment** - we don't quit until solved

### Phase 2: Systematic Investigation (Never Stop Until Solved)
**Follow this decision tree in EXACT order - log every step:**

1. **Has this error occurred before?** 
   - CHECK `.troubleshoot/` for identical issues
   - CHECK `.logs/` for similar problems in past sessions
   - If found ‚Üí Apply previous solution, verify, document outcome

2. **Is this a known pattern?** 
   - CHECK `IMPLEMENTATION-PATTERNS.md`
   - CHECK `TROUBLESHOOTING-PROCESS.md`
   - If pattern found ‚Üí Apply pattern, test, document

3. **Is this a framework/dependency issue?**
   - CHECK package.json versions
   - CHECK framework documentation
   - CHECK environment variables and configuration
   - If issue found ‚Üí Fix, test, document

4. **Is this a code logic issue?**
   - ANALYZE recent changes
   - REVIEW git diff for suspicious modifications
   - TEST individual components
   - If logic error found ‚Üí Fix, test, document

5. **Is this an environment issue?**
   - CHECK .env files
   - CHECK deployment configuration
   - CHECK browser/system compatibility
   - If environment issue ‚Üí Fix, test, document

### Phase 3: Advanced Debugging (When Standard Steps Fail)
**If problem persists after Phase 2 - escalate investigation:**

6. **Deep code analysis**
   - TRACE execution flow step by step
   - ADD debugging logs to identify failure point
   - ISOLATE problem to specific function/component

7. **External research**
   - SEARCH Stack Overflow for exact error
   - CHECK official documentation
   - RESEARCH GitHub issues for similar problems

8. **Experimental solutions**
   - TRY alternative approaches
   - TEST edge cases and boundary conditions
   - EXPERIMENT with different configurations

### Phase 4: Solution Implementation & Prevention
**Once solution found:**

9. **IMPLEMENT fix** with thorough testing
10. **DOCUMENT complete solution** in `.troubleshoot/issue-XXX.md`
11. **UPDATE prevention measures** to avoid recurrence
12. **COMMIT working solution** with detailed explanation
13. **UPDATE troubleshooting knowledge base**

### üö® CRITICAL RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS

- **NEVER give up** - troubleshooting continues until solved
- **NEVER repeat failed attempts** - if something didn't work, try different approach
- **ALWAYS log every step** - document what was tried and results
- **ALWAYS verify solution** - test thoroughly before declaring solved
- **ALWAYS prevent recurrence** - update code/docs to prevent future issues

### Troubleshooting Session Log Template

## üîÑ WORKFLOW AUTOMATION

### Automatic Workflow Enforcement

#### On Project Start
1. READ `PROJECT-DECISION-MATRIX.md` to select stack
2. CREATE project folder with standard structure
3. LOG every decision in `.logs/YYYY-MM-DD-session.md`
4. UPDATE `SESSION-MEMORY.md` after each major task

#### Before Writing Code
**üî¥ MANDATORY: Check ALL logs to prevent redundancy and wasted effort**

1. **CHECK `.troubleshoot/`** ‚Üí Has this exact problem been solved before?
2. **CHECK `.progress/`** ‚Üí Has this task already been completed?
3. **CHECK `.logs/`** ‚Üí What was tried in previous sessions?
4. **CHECK `.research/`** ‚Üí Has this information already been gathered?
5. **CHECK `IMPLEMENTATION-PATTERNS.md`** ‚Üí Is there an existing pattern?
6. **CHECK `SESSION-MEMORY.md`** ‚Üí What's the current state and blockers?

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER repeat work that's already been done - always check logs first**

7. **USE appropriate prompt** from `PROMPT-ENGINEERING-TEMPLATES.md`

#### When Stuck/Debugging
1. STOP - Don't repeat failed attempts
2. READ `TROUBLESHOOTING-PROCESS.md`
3. CHECK `.troubleshoot/` for previous solutions
4. LOG the issue and solution in `.troubleshoot/issue-XXX.md`
5. UPDATE `SESSION-MEMORY.md` with blocker status

#### After Each Work Session
1. SAVE progress to `.progress/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. UPDATE `SESSION-MEMORY.md` with current state
3. COMMIT working code with descriptive message
4. LOG session summary in `.logs/`

## üìù SESSION MEMORY TEMPLATE

Every project must maintain `SESSION-MEMORY.md`:
```markdown
# Current Project State

## Last Updated: [timestamp]

## Completed
- [x] Task 1 (reference: .logs/2024-01-15-session.md#task1)
- [x] Task 2 (reference: .progress/2024-01-15.md)

## üéØ SPECIALIZED AGENTS & TOOLS

### Available Specialized Agents
- **statusline-setup**: Configure Claude Code status line
- **output-style-setup**: Create custom output modes  
- **general-purpose**: Complex multi-step research and implementation

### MCP Tools Configuration
```bash
# Essential for this project
claude mcp add filesystem -- npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem [project-path]
claude mcp add git -- npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-git
claude mcp add nodejs -- npx @tymek/mcp-nodejs
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow
- Use specialized agents for complex research tasks
- Delegate image processing and media management
- Use separate agents for deployment and testing
- Coordinate multiple agents for large projects
