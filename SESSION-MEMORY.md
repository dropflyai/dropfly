# OS App Builder - Session Memory

## Last Updated: 2025-01-18 [Current Session]

## ðŸ”¥ MANDATORY LOGGING STANDARDS

**CRITICAL RULE: If it's not logged, it didn't happen**

### Real-Time Logging Requirements
- **Before ANY work**: Create session log `.logs/YYYY-MM-DD-session.md`
- **During work**: Log every major decision, error, and solution
- **After work**: Update SESSION-MEMORY.md with current state
- **Daily**: Save progress summary to `.progress/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### Session Backup Checklist (COMPLETE EVERY SESSION)
```markdown
- [ ] All code committed to Git with session reference
- [ ] Session logged in `.logs/YYYY-MM-DD-session.md` (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Major updates logged in `.progress/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (MANDATORY)
- [ ] SESSION-MEMORY.md updated with current state (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Any new assets saved to `.assets/`
- [ ] All research saved to `.research/`
- [ ] Any issues documented in `.troubleshoot/`
- [ ] Next session priorities documented
- [ ] Working/broken/blocked status documented
```

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: New Project Startup Sequence

**When user says "let's start a new project" - follow this EXACT sequence:**

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering (ONE AT A TIME)
```
ðŸ”´ STOP - Ask these questions ONE AT A TIME until complete:
1. What is the business/client name?
2. What type of business is it?
3. What is the main goal of this project?
4. Do they have existing website/presence to research?
5. What key features do they need?
6. What are their brand colors/aesthetic?
7. Who is their target audience?
8. What is the timeline/priority level?

âœ… ONLY proceed to Phase 2 when ALL requirements documented
```

### Phase 2: Project Setup & Logging Infrastructure
```
ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL: Set up complete logging system BEFORE any development
1. Create project folder with standard structure
2. Initialize comprehensive logging system
3. Start logging IMMEDIATELY - every decision
4. Check ALL existing logs before starting ANY work
5. Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore
```

### Phase 3: Enterprise Backend Framework (MANDATORY FIRST)
- Apply Enterprise Backend Framework using PROJECT-INITIALIZATION-PROMPTS.md
- Database schema with 15+ tables and RLS
- Performance indexes and monitoring
- Complete documentation

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Protocol Enhanced

**When user says "RUN TROUBLESHOOTING PROTOCOL":**
- Triggers UNSTOPPABLE debugging sequence until solution found
- 4-phase systematic approach with complete logging
- Never give up until problem solved
- Document everything for future prevention
- Update knowledge base with solution

## Workflow Enforcement Rules (UPDATED)
1. **ALWAYS check ALL logs first** to prevent redundancy
2. **MANDATORY logging** - every session, every decision, every update
3. **Create standard folder structure** with logging infrastructure
4. **Check troubleshooting docs** before any debugging
5. **Update session memory** after EVERY major task
6. **Complete session backup checklist** before ending work
7. **Never repeat work** - always check existing files first

## Key Framework Features
- **Redundancy Prevention**: Check logs before ANY work
- **Unstoppable Troubleshooting**: Never give up until solved
- **Enterprise Backend Standards**: Security-first, production-ready
- **Complete Logging**: Every decision, error, and solution documented
- **Session Continuity**: Full state maintained between sessions

## Environment Setup
- **Location**: /Users/rioallen/Documents/OS-App-Builder
- **Stack Ready**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Supabase
- **Components**: Dark luxury theme with gold accents (#f4c900)
- **Dependencies**: All npm commands working
- **Logging**: Complete infrastructure templates ready

## Performance Metrics
- Framework creation time: ~45 minutes
- Enhanced documentation: 9 comprehensive guides
- Logging templates: Complete session and troubleshooting logs
- Patterns documented: 50+ implementation examples with redundancy checks
- Time saved per project: ~2-3 days of planning + eliminated redundant work

## Session History & Decisions
- **Enhanced logging requirements**: Mandatory for all sessions
- **Unstoppable troubleshooting**: Never give up protocol implemented
- **Redundancy prevention**: Check all logs before starting work
- **New project sequence**: Crystal clear 3-phase approach
- **Senior developer onboarding**: Complete system documentation created

## Notes
- **Productivity over perfection**: Ship fast with quality
- **Document everything**: If not logged, it didn't happen
- **Challenge assumptions**: Question requirements when appropriate
- **No token waste**: Always check existing work first
- **Enterprise standards**: Every backend must meet security/performance criteria

## Next Actions for Any New Project
1. **Follow exact startup sequence** from PROJECT-INITIALIZATION-PROMPTS.md
2. **Ask business questions** ONE AT A TIME until complete
3. **Set up logging infrastructure** BEFORE any development
4. **Apply Enterprise Backend Framework** as mandatory first step
5. **Check ALL logs** before starting any work to prevent redundancy
6. **Document everything** in real-time throughout session
7. **Complete session backup checklist** before ending work
