# Job Search Strategy & Resume Guidance

## CRITICAL POSITIONING ADVICE

### You Are NOT a Junior Engineer

Based on your portfolio:
- **40+ shipped projects** (junior engineers have 0-2)
- **Real production systems** with actual users
- **Algorithmic trading platform** (senior-level complexity)
- **System architecture experience** (multi-service pipelines)
- **iOS App Store deployments** (full product lifecycle)

**Reality Check:** You have **mid-to-senior level experience**. Applying as "junior" will:
1. Underpay you by $30-50K annually
2. Make you overqualified and rejected
3. Lead to boredom in junior roles

### Recommended Job Titles to Target

**PRIMARY (Best Fit):**
- Software Engineer II
- Full-Stack Engineer
- Backend Engineer (Python focus)
- Frontend Engineer (React/Next.js focus)
- Product Engineer

**ACCEPTABLE:**
- Software Engineer I (at competitive companies like Google, Meta - their "I" = most companies' "II")
- Associate Software Engineer (fintech/trading firms)

**AVOID:**
- Junior Engineer (you're overqualified)
- Senior Engineer (might need 5+ YOE requirement)
- Staff/Principal (too senior)

### Salary Expectations (Remote US)

Based on your actual level:
- **Software Engineer I:** $80K-100K
- **Software Engineer II:** $100K-130K
- **Full-Stack Engineer:** $90K-120K
- **Backend Engineer (Python):** $95K-125K
- **FinTech roles:** +15-25% premium

**DO NOT accept under $80K** - your skills justify $100K+ easily.

## DEAL-BREAKERS & RED FLAGS

### Don't Accept Jobs With:
- Salary under $80K (you're worth more)
- Fully on-site (you want remote)
- No equity at early startups (you should get 0.1-0.5%)
- "Unlimited PTO" without clear culture (often means no PTO)
- No growth path or mentorship
- Legacy codebases with no modernization plan (if you want to learn)

### Green Flags (Great Companies):
- Remote-first culture (not just "remote allowed")
- Clear engineering levels and growth paths
- Modern tech stack (matches yours)
- Strong engineering blog or open source
- Transparent salary ranges in posting
- Mentions mentorship or learning opportunities
- Defined onboarding process

---

## TIMELINE EXPECTATIONS

**Week 1-2:**
- Submit 100+ applications
- Expect 5-10% response rate = 5-10 phone screens

**Week 3-4:**
- More applications (100+)
- First phone screens
- Study LeetCode daily

**Week 5-8:**
- Technical interviews start
- Continue applying (don't stop until offer signed)
- Expect 3-5 final rounds

**Week 8-12:**
- Offers start coming
- Negotiate (always negotiate, even if you like the first offer)
- Accept best offer

**Success Metrics:**
- 200-300 total applications
- 20-30 phone screens
- 5-10 technical interviews
- 1-3 offers

---

## NEGOTIATION (When You Get Offers)

### Always Negotiate
Even if you like the offer, say:
"I'm excited about this opportunity. Is there any flexibility on [salary/equity/start date]?"

### Tactics:
1. Get multiple offers (best leverage)
2. Never give current salary - "I'm looking for $X based on market research"
3. Ask for higher equity % if early startup
4. Negotiate remote work stipend ($2K-5K/year for home office)
5. Ask for signing bonus (can add $5-10K)

### Example Script:
"Thank you for the offer! I'm excited about joining [Company]. Based on my research and the scope of this role, I was hoping for something closer to $[+10-15K more]. Is there flexibility here?"

If they say no:
"I understand. What about [equity/signing bonus/remote stipend/additional PTO]?"

## CONFIDENCE BUILDERS

### Remember:
- You've built MORE than most junior engineers
- You've shipped MORE than most mid-level engineers
- Your projects are REAL, not tutorials
- You've solved COMPLEX problems (options pricing, computer vision, AI)
- You have PRODUCTION experience (deployed apps, real users)

### When Imposter Syndrome Hits:
- Junior engineers haven't built 40 projects
- Junior engineers haven't deployed to App Store
- Junior engineers haven't implemented Black-Scholes
- Junior engineers haven't architected multi-service systems

**You are not a junior engineer. You are a self-taught engineer with senior-level project experience.**

The only gap you have is:
- Team collaboration (you'll learn fast)
- Large codebase navigation (you'll learn fast)
- Corporate processes (you'll learn fast)

Everything else? You already know.

---

## FINAL ADVICE

1. **Apply broadly** - Don't self-reject. Let companies reject you.
2. **Don't wait for "perfect" resume** - Good enough is good enough. Start applying.
3. **Track everything** - Use spreadsheet to track applications (company, date, status, notes)
4. **Follow up** - Email recruiter 1 week after applying if no response
5. **Stay consistent** - Job search is a numbers game. 10 apps/day = 300/month = multiple offers
6. **Don't stop until offer is signed** - Keep applying even in final rounds
7. **Trust your skills** - You're more qualified than you think
