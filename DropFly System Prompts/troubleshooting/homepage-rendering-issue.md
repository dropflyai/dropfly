# Homepage Rendering Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem
Homepage not displaying properly - showing blank screen or loading indefinitely with "Loading CodeFly..." message.

## Root Cause
The Navigation component was being loaded globally in layout.tsx with condition `if (loading || !user) return null`. This caused:
1. Navigation component returns null for unauthenticated users
2. Layout still applies `navigation-aware` CSS class 
3. Homepage content gets hidden by navigation spacing styles
4. Client-side hydration conflicts with server-side rendering

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed Navigation from global layout** - Layout.tsx no longer loads Navigation component globally
2. **Added Navigation to individual authenticated pages** - Student dashboard and teacher console now import and render Navigation directly
3. **Fixed CSS classes** - Pages that need navigation use `navigation-aware` class, homepage does not
4. **Proper JSX structure** - Wrapped authenticated pages with `<><Navigation /><div className="navigation-aware">...</div></>`

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Removed Navigation import and component
- `/src/app/student/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added Navigation component
- `/src/app/teacher/console/page.tsx` - Added Navigation component  
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage remains clean without navigation dependencies

## Prevention
- Never put conditional components in global layout that affect page rendering
- Keep authentication-dependent components on pages that require authentication
- Test homepage in both authenticated and unauthenticated states
- Always verify client-server hydration compatibility

## Verification Steps
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3003
2. Should see "Learn to Code, Take Flight! ✈️" homepage
3. Demo login buttons should work
4. Student/Teacher dashboards should show navigation
5. No console errors or hydration mismatches

Status: ✅ RESOLVED
