# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- **Start development server**: `npm run dev`
- **Build for production**: `npm build`
- **Start production server**: `npm start`
- **Install dependencies**: `npm install`

## Architecture Overview

This is the DropFly OS App Builder - a Next.js application built as a luxury app builder with a dark theme and gold accent colors (#f4c900). The project follows a component-based architecture:

**Component System**: Located in `components/ui/`, the project uses a custom UI component library with consistent styling:
- All components use a dark theme with black/gray backgrounds
- Gold gradient accents (#f4c900 to #b68600) for primary elements
- Rounded corners (20px-30px radius) and shadow effects for luxury appearance
- Components are functional React components with props-based configuration

**Styling Approach**: 
- Global styles in `styles/globals.css` set black background and white text
- Inline Tailwind CSS classes for component styling
- Consistent color palette: black (#000, #111, #222), gold (#f4c900), and gradients
- Typography uses serif fonts for luxury aesthetic

**Tech Stack**:
- Next.js framework with React 
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Hot Toast for notifications
- No TypeScript - all files use .js extension

**Project Structure**:
- `components/ui/` - Reusable UI components (Button, Card, Input, Switch, Textarea)
- `pages/` - Next.js pages (currently empty)
- `public/images/` - Static assets
- `styles/` - Global CSS

The components are designed for an "elite developer" experience with luxury branding and premium visual effects.

## üèóÔ∏è ENTERPRISE BACKEND FRAMEWORK

**MANDATORY**: Every project MUST start with enterprise-grade backend infrastructure using our standardized framework.

### Framework Standards
- **Security First**: Multi-tenant RLS on ALL tables from day one
- **Performance Optimized**: Strategic indexes and query optimization
- **Production Ready**: Monitoring, alerts, and operational excellence
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for growth from startup to enterprise

### Implementation Requirements

**Before ANY frontend development:**
1. **Apply Enterprise Backend Framework** using `PROJECT-INITIALIZATION-PROMPTS.md`
2. **Database Schema**: 15+ tables with comprehensive relationships
3. **Security Policies**: RLS protection on every table
4. **Performance Optimization**: Indexes on all critical queries  
5. **Business Logic**: Edge Functions with proper validation
6. **Monitoring Systems**: Health checks and alerting
7. **Quality Gate**: Complete audit using `QUICK-START-REFERENCE.md`

### Framework Files
- `ENTERPRISE-BACKEND-FRAMEWORK.md` - Complete methodology and templates
- `PROJECT-INITIALIZATION-PROMPTS.md` - Copy-paste prompts for new projects
- `QUICK-START-REFERENCE.md` - Quality gates and checklists

### Success Criteria
- **Security**: 100% RLS coverage, zero data leakage between tenants
- **Performance**: <200ms average query time, 99.9% uptime
- **Scalability**: Multi-tenant architecture supporting unlimited growth
- **Operations**: Full monitoring with automated alerts and recovery

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: All backends must meet enterprise standards before proceeding to frontend development.

## PROJECT MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW

### New Project Initialization

**üö® CRITICAL**: When user says "let's start a new project", follow this EXACT sequence:

**üî¥ STOP - Do NOT proceed until ALL steps completed in order**

**üö® ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Every new project MUST have complete system infrastructure:
- ‚úÖ All folder structure created (.logs/, .docs/, .troubleshoot/, etc.)
- ‚úÖ ALL system files copied (save-version.sh, troubleshooting protocols, frameworks)
- ‚úÖ Project-specific CLAUDE.md created
- ‚úÖ SESSION-MEMORY.md initialized
- ‚úÖ Verification checklist completed

**If ANY system file is missing, the project setup is INCOMPLETE and MUST be fixed immediately.**

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering (MANDATORY: Ask ONE AT A TIME)
1. **Ask Questions (ONE AT A TIME)** until you have complete information:
   - What is the business/client name?
   - What type of business is it? (restaurant, retail, service, etc.)
   - What is the main goal of this project? (demo site, full website, specific features?)
   - Do they have an existing website or online presence to research?
   - What are the key features they need? (AI chat, voice agent, e-commerce, etc.)
   - What is their brand colors/aesthetic preference?
   - Who is their target audience?
   - What is the timeline/priority level?

**‚úÖ ONLY proceed to Phase 2 when ALL requirements are documented**

### Phase 2: Enterprise Backend Framework (MANDATORY FIRST)
2. **Apply Enterprise Backend Framework** - Use initialization prompt from `PROJECT-INITIALIZATION-PROMPTS.md`
   - Database schema with 15+ tables
   - Row Level Security on every table
   - Performance indexes and monitoring
   - Complete documentation

### Phase 3: Project Setup & Logging Infrastructure
3. **Create project folder with standard structure**:
   ```
   project-name/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .logs/          # Session logs (MANDATORY)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .docs/          # Documentation + System files (MANDATORY)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .research/      # Web scraping, API responses
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .assets/        # Downloaded images, logos, media
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .credentials/   # API keys, deployment tokens (NEVER commit)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .troubleshoot/  # Problem solutions and fixes
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .progress/      # Completed tasks log
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ versions-archive/ # Version backups (MANDATORY)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ save-version.sh # Version saving script (MANDATORY)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md       # Project-specific instructions (MANDATORY)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SESSION-MEMORY.md # Current project state (MANDATORY)
   ```

4. **üî• CRITICAL: Copy ALL system files to project**
   ```bash
   # MANDATORY: Copy these files to EVERY new project
   cp /Users/rioallen/Documents/DropFly-OS-App-Builder/save-version.sh ./
   chmod +x save-version.sh
   cp /Users/rioallen/Documents/DropFly-OS-App-Builder/TROUBLESHOOTING-PROCESS.md ./.docs/
   cp /Users/rioallen/Documents/DropFly-OS-App-Builder/ENTERPRISE-BACKEND-FRAMEWORK.md ./.docs/
   cp /Users/rioallen/Documents/DropFly-OS-App-Builder/PROJECT-INITIALIZATION-PROMPTS.md ./.docs/
   cp /Users/rioallen/Documents/DropFly-OS-App-Builder/QUICK-START-REFERENCE.md ./.docs/
   cp /Users/rioallen/Documents/DropFly-OS-App-Builder/ENTERPRISE-ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md ./.docs/
   ```

5. **üî• CRITICAL: Start logging IMMEDIATELY**
   - Create `.logs/YYYY-MM-DD-project-initialization.md`
   - Log EVERY decision in session logs
   - Update SESSION-MEMORY.md after EVERY major task
   - Check ALL existing logs before starting ANY work

6. **Create Project-Specific CLAUDE.md** with complete business context
7. **Create Comprehensive Action Plan** with detailed steps
8. **Create Detailed Todo List** with all tasks broken down

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER work without logging - if it's not logged, it didn't happen**

### üö® MANDATORY SYSTEM FILES - NO EXCEPTIONS

**HARD RULE**: Every single project MUST have ALL system files copied. NO EXCEPTIONS.

**If ANY of these files are missing, STOP and copy them immediately:**
- ‚ùå Missing `save-version.sh` ‚Üí Copy and make executable
- ‚ùå Missing `.docs/TROUBLESHOOTING-PROCESS.md` ‚Üí Copy from DropFly-OS-App-Builder
- ‚ùå Missing `.docs/ENTERPRISE-BACKEND-FRAMEWORK.md` ‚Üí Copy from DropFly-OS-App-Builder
- ‚ùå Missing `CLAUDE.md` ‚Üí Create project-specific version
- ‚ùå Missing `SESSION-MEMORY.md` ‚Üí Create with current state
- ‚ùå Missing `versions-archive/` folder ‚Üí Create directory

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST - Run before ANY work:**
```bash
# Verify all system files exist
ls save-version.sh || echo "‚ùå MISSING save-version.sh"
ls .docs/TROUBLESHOOTING-PROCESS.md || echo "‚ùå MISSING troubleshooting protocol"
ls .docs/ENTERPRISE-BACKEND-FRAMEWORK.md || echo "‚ùå MISSING framework docs"
ls CLAUDE.md || echo "‚ùå MISSING project CLAUDE.md"
ls SESSION-MEMORY.md || echo "‚ùå MISSING session memory"
ls -d versions-archive/ || echo "‚ùå MISSING versions-archive folder"
```

**If ANY files are missing, the project is NOT properly set up.**

### Project Isolation & Security

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Projects are ALWAYS separated and NEVER merged
- Each client gets their own dedicated folder
- Each project gets its own Git repository
- Each project gets its own Vercel deployment
- No cross-contamination of client data, designs, or code
- All client information stays within their project folder

### Documentation & Logging

**üî• MANDATORY LOGGING - Every Session, Every Update, Every Decision**

**CRITICAL RULE: If it's not logged, it didn't happen**

**Before ANY work**:
- Create session log `.logs/YYYY-MM-DD-session.md`
- Check ALL existing logs to prevent redundancy:
  - `.troubleshoot/` ‚Üí Has this problem been solved before?
  - `.progress/` ‚Üí Has this task already been completed?
  - `.logs/` ‚Üí What was tried in previous sessions?
  - `.research/` ‚Üí Has this information already been gathered?

**During work**:
- Log every major decision and why it was made
- Log every error encountered and solution attempted
- Save all API responses, web scraping results, and research in markdown files
- Update SESSION-MEMORY.md after every major task

**After work**:
- Complete mandatory session backup checklist
- Save troubleshooting steps and solutions in `.troubleshoot/`
- Update `.progress/` with completed tasks
- **Never repeat the same research** - always check existing files first

**Folder Structure (MANDATORY)**:
- `.logs/` ‚Üí Session logs with timestamps
- `.docs/` ‚Üí All documentation
- `.research/` ‚Üí Business research and web scraping results
- `.assets/` ‚Üí Downloaded images, logos, and media
- `.credentials/` ‚Üí API keys, deployment tokens (NEVER commit)
- `.troubleshoot/` ‚Üí Problem solutions and fixes
- `.progress/` ‚Üí Completed tasks log

### Credentials & Security Management

**Create `.credentials/` folder structure**:
- `.credentials/api-keys.md` - API keys and tokens
- `.credentials/deployment.md` - Vercel tokens, GitHub keys
- `.credentials/accounts.md` - Login information and accounts
- **NEVER commit credentials to Git** - add to .gitignore
- Always encrypt or obfuscate sensitive information
- Use environment variables for production deployments

### Quality Assurance & Verification

**Before Reporting Completion**:
1. **Thoroughly examine your work** - review every file change
2. **Test functionality** - verify all features work as expected
3. **Check deployment** - ensure live site is actually updated
4. **Verify branding** - confirm authentic colors, logos, and content
5. **Test responsive design** - check mobile and desktop views
6. **Validate links and navigation** - ensure all pages work
7. **If anything is broken** - create new action steps and keep working until solved

**Never report completion until everything is verified working**

### Multi-Agent Workflow

**Deploy Multiple Agents When Needed**:
- Use specialized agents for complex research tasks
- Delegate image processing and media management
- Use separate agents for deployment and testing
- Coordinate multiple agents for large projects
- Always document which agent did what work

## CRITICAL FRAMEWORKS TO REFERENCE

**ALWAYS CHECK THESE FILES FIRST:**
1. **STARTUP-REQUIREMENTS-FRAMEWORK.md** - For project planning and requirements
2. **ENTERPRISE-ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md** - For technical architecture decisions
3. **IMPLEMENTATION-PATTERNS.md** - For code patterns and examples
4. **PROJECT-DECISION-MATRIX.md** - For stack selection and quick starts
5. **PROMPT-ENGINEERING-TEMPLATES.md** - For phase-specific approaches
6. **TROUBLESHOOTING-PROCESS.md** - For systematic problem solving (check before debugging)
7. **SESSION-MEMORY.md** - For current project state and progress

## AUTOMATIC WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT

### On Project Start
1. **READ** `PROJECT-DECISION-MATRIX.md` to select stack
2. **CREATE** project folder with standard structure:
   ```
   project-name/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .logs/          # Session logs (YYYY-MM-DD-session.md)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .docs/          # Documentation
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .research/      # Web scraping, API responses
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .troubleshoot/  # Problem solutions
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .progress/      # Completed tasks log
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md       # Project-specific instructions
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SESSION-MEMORY.md # Current state
   ```
3. **LOG** every decision in `.logs/YYYY-MM-DD-session.md`
4. **UPDATE** `SESSION-MEMORY.md` after each major task

### Before Writing Code
1. **CHECK** `.troubleshoot/` for similar problems already solved
2. **CHECK** `IMPLEMENTATION-PATTERNS.md` for the correct pattern
3. **CHECK** `.progress/` to avoid repeating completed work
4. **USE** appropriate prompt from `PROMPT-ENGINEERING-TEMPLATES.md`

### When Stuck/Debugging
1. **STOP** - Don't repeat attempts
2. **READ** `TROUBLESHOOTING-PROCESS.md`
3. **CHECK** `.troubleshoot/` for previous solutions
4. **LOG** the issue and solution in `.troubleshoot/issue-XXX.md`
5. **UPDATE** `SESSION-MEMORY.md` with blocker status

### After Each Work Session
1. **SAVE** progress to `.progress/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. **UPDATE** `SESSION-MEMORY.md` with current state
3. **COMMIT** working code with descriptive message
4. **LOG** session summary in `.logs/`

## SESSION MEMORY TEMPLATE

Every project must maintain `SESSION-MEMORY.md`:
```markdown
# Current Project State

## Last Updated: [timestamp]

## Completed
- [x] Task 1 (reference: .logs/2024-01-15-session.md#task1)
- [x] Task 2 (reference: .progress/2024-01-15.md)

## In Progress
- [ ] Current task: [description]

- Deployment: .credentials/deployment.md
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING DECISION TREE

Before attempting ANY fix:
1. **Has this error occurred before?** ‚Üí Check `.troubleshoot/`
2. **Is this a known pattern?** ‚Üí Check `IMPLEMENTATION-PATTERNS.md`
3. **Is this a framework issue?** ‚Üí Check framework docs
4. **Is this a dependency issue?** ‚Üí Check package.json versions
