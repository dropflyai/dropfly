### About Section (Max 2,600 chars) - CRITICAL SECTION

```
From film sets to tech products. Here's how it happened:

After 7+ years as a cinematographer, I made a bet: what if I could use AI to build tech products as fast as I could shoot and edit videos?

Two years later, I've shipped 40+ production applications — trading platforms, AI SaaS tools, mobile apps, video processing systems — all built using AI agents, automation, and modern development workflows.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT I BUILD:

• Algorithmic trading platforms (real-time market data, iOS apps, web dashboards)
• AI-powered automation systems (lead intelligence, voice agents, workflow orchestration)
• Video processing tools (computer vision, format conversion, 50+ platform support)
• SaaS products (15+ production apps with auth, payments, databases, deployment)
• Mobile apps (iOS App Store deployments, React Native, Swift)

TECH STACK:
AI: Claude Code, Claude API, GPT-4, AI agent orchestration
Automation: n8n, Zapier, API integration (20+ APIs)
Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Python, Node.js, FastAPI
Databases: PostgreSQL, Supabase, Redis
Cloud: AWS, Vercel, Firebase
Mobile: React Native, Swift/SwiftUI
Creative: Video production, marketing, branding

CERTIFICATIONS:
📜 IBM Generative AI Professional

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY I'M DIFFERENT:

Most developers code. I orchestrate AI agents to build complete products.

Most technical people can't create marketing assets. I shoot, edit, and produce videos from my film career.

Most builders focus on one thing. I ship full products: design, frontend, backend, mobile, infrastructure, testing, deployment, marketing materials, demo videos.

What takes traditional dev teams 3-6 months, I ship in 3-6 weeks.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:

Remote roles where speed, versatility, and AI-native workflows are valued:

✓ Solutions Engineer / Implementation Engineer
✓ AI Automation Specialist / Integration Engineer
✓ Technical Product Manager / Product Engineer
✓ Growth Engineer / RevOps Engineer
✓ Developer Relations / Advocate
✓ Founding Engineer at AI-first startups

I want to work with teams building the future, not maintaining the past.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Let's build something remarkable.

## INTERVIEW PREP

### Phone Screen (You'll Get These First)

**Questions you'll hear:**

**1. "Tell me about yourself"**

**YOUR ANSWER (60-90 seconds):**
"I spent 7 years as a cinematographer before transitioning to tech 2 years ago. I made the switch because I saw AI could democratize building — I could use AI agents to ship products as fast as I could produce videos.

Since then, I've built 40+ production applications using AI-assisted development: algorithmic trading platforms, AI-powered SaaS tools, mobile apps in the App Store, video processing systems.

My unique value is speed and versatility. I can ship complete products — frontend, backend, mobile, infrastructure, and even marketing materials thanks to my film background — in weeks instead of months. What takes traditional dev teams 3-6 months, I deliver in 3-6 weeks using AI orchestration.

I'm looking for a role where that speed and versatility is valued, which is why I'm excited about [this role/company]."

---

**2. "Walk me through a project you're proud of"**

**Use TradeFly or LeadFly. Structure:**

**SITUATION:** "I wanted to build a complete algorithmic trading platform from scratch."

**TASK:** "The challenge was integrating real-time market data, implementing options pricing models, building a frontend dashboard, creating a mobile app, and deploying everything to production — all within 6 weeks."

**ACTION:** "I used AI agents for development:
- Claude Code to generate the Black-Scholes pricing algorithms and technical analysis code
- AI-assisted frontend development for the Next.js dashboard with real-time WebSocket updates
- Swift/SwiftUI AI generation for the iOS app
- Systematic automation for deployment (AWS EC2, Vercel, App Store)

I built the Python backend (14,000+ lines), integrated Polygon.io API for market data, created the web dashboard, shipped the iOS app, and deployed everything in production."

**RESULT:** "Full trading platform competitive with institutional tools, built solo in 6 weeks. Zero production incidents, real users, and proving that AI-assisted development can achieve 10x speed without sacrificing quality."

**WHAT YOU LEARNED:** "AI agents are incredible for speed, but you still need to understand architecture, databases, APIs, and deployment. The AI accelerates you, but product thinking and systematic processes are irreplaceable."

---

**3. "Why are you looking for a job? / Why do you want to leave your current situation?"**

**YOUR ANSWER:**
"I've been building independently for 2 years, which has been incredible for learning and proving I can ship. But I'm looking to join a team for a few reasons:

One, I want to learn from experienced engineers. Building solo means I've developed my own processes, but I know there's so much I could learn from senior engineers and structured engineering teams.

Two, I want to work on a product with real impact at scale. I've built 40+ products, but I want to focus my energy on one product that's growing and helping lots of people, rather than spreading myself across many projects.

Three, I miss collaboration. My film background was all about teamwork — directors, producers, actors, crew. I'm naturally collaborative and I want to work with a team again.

This role at [Company] is exciting because [specific reason related to job/company]."

---

**4. "What are your salary expectations?"**

**YOUR ANSWER:**
"I'm looking for something in the $80K-110K range for a full-time remote role, depending on the responsibilities, growth opportunities, and equity if it's a startup. What's the budgeted range for this position?"

**Notes:**
- Don't go first if possible ("What's the range for this role?")
- If pressed, give a range, not a single number
- For Solutions Engineer: $80-120K
- For Product Engineer: $85-120K
- For AI Automation: $75-110K
- For Startups: Lower salary + equity (0.1-1%)

---

**5. "What's your technical background? / You're not a traditional developer..."**

**YOUR ANSWER:**
"You're right — I'm not a traditional CS grad, and that's actually my advantage.

I learned to build by building real products, not through theory. In 2 years I've shipped 40+ production apps, which gave me practical knowledge of full-stack development, APIs, databases, deployment, and all the messy real-world stuff you don't learn in bootcamps.

My approach is AI-native. I orchestrate Claude Code and AI agents to accelerate development, which means I can ship 10x faster than traditional methods. This isn't about not knowing how to code — it's about using the best tools available in 2024 to maximize output.

And my film background is an advantage in product roles: I understand user experience (visual storytelling), I can create marketing materials (video production), and I know how to ship under tight deadlines (film sets are intense).

The proof is in the work: 40+ production apps, multiple iOS apps in the App Store, zero production incidents, and systems handling real users and real money."

---

### Technical Conversations

**You might get asked about:**

**"How do you handle X technically?"**

**Strategy:** Use your real projects as examples
- "When I built LeadFly, I needed to handle duplicate detection..."
- "For TradeFly's real-time updates, I used WebSockets because..."
- "In the video processing tool, I chose FFmpeg over X because..."

**Be honest:** "I use AI agents to help me build, but I understand the architecture and make the technical decisions."

**Strengths:** System design, APIs, databases, deployment, product thinking
**Gaps:** Advanced algorithms (admit this, say you're eager to learn)

---

**"How do you test your code?"**

**YOUR ANSWER:**
"I use a combination of automated and manual testing:

For critical paths, I use Playwright for end-to-end testing — making sure user flows work correctly in production.

For APIs, I test using Postman and automated curl scripts to verify endpoints.

For deployment, I have systematic checklists to verify database migrations, environment variables, and production builds before going live.

The result: across 40+ production apps and 15+ deployed SaaS products, I've had zero production incidents. That's because I treat testing as non-negotiable, not optional."

---

### Portfolio Presentation

**They might ask:** "Show me one of your projects"

**Be ready to share screen and walk through:**
1. **Live product** (if publicly accessible)
2. **GitHub repo** (even if AI-generated, explain architecture)
3. **Demo video** (use your film skills to create 2-min walkthrough)

**Good demo structure:**
- "Here's the problem this solves..."
- "Here's how a user interacts with it..." [show UI]
- "Behind the scenes, here's the architecture..." [show diagram or code]
- "And here's the outcome..." [metrics, user feedback, or learning]

Is there any flexibility on the base salary?"

**If they say no:**
"I understand. What about [equity / signing bonus / remote stipend / additional PTO / professional development budget]?"

---

### Use Competing Offers

**If you have multiple offers (ideal):**

"I have another offer at $[higher amount]. I prefer working at [Company] because [genuine reason], but I need to make a financially responsible decision. Can you match [or get closer to] $[amount]?"

---

### Equity Negotiation (Startups)

**Understand equity:**
- Pre-seed/Seed: 0.5% - 2% for early engineers
- Series A: 0.1% - 0.5%
- Series B+: 0.05% - 0.2%

**Ask these questions:**
1. "How many shares outstanding?" (to calculate your %)
2. "What's the current valuation?" (to know equity value)
3. "What's the vesting schedule?" (standard: 4 years, 1-year cliff)
4. "What's the strike price?" (cost to exercise options)

**If salary is low but equity seems good:**
"I'm comfortable with $[lower salary] if we can increase the equity to [higher %]. I believe in the company's growth and want to be aligned with that upside."

## COMMON OBJECTIONS & HOW TO HANDLE

### "You don't have a CS degree"

**Response:**
"That's true, and here's why it hasn't held me back: I've built 40+ production apps in 2 years, which gave me hands-on experience with full-stack development, databases, APIs, cloud infrastructure, and deployment.

Formal CS education is valuable, but shipping real products taught me practical skills. I understand data structures through building actual systems, I understand algorithms through solving real problems, and I understand architecture through deploying production apps.

The proof is in the work: [show portfolio]. I'm confident I can contribute from day one."

---

### "You've only been in tech 2 years"

**Response:**
"Quality over quantity. In 2 years I've shipped 40+ production applications — that's more than many developers ship in 5-10 years.

I've deployed to AWS, built real-time trading systems, integrated 20+ APIs, shipped iOS apps to the App Store, and handled production infrastructure with zero incidents.

The density of my learning has been intense because I've been building constantly, not just at a day job but as a full-time obsession. I'd put my 2 years of shipping against many people's 5 years of traditional experience."

---

### "How do you work in a team if you've been solo?"

**Response:**
"Great question. My film background was entirely team-based — cinematographers don't work alone, you're collaborating with directors, producers, actors, grips, gaffers, editors.

I understand:
- Clear communication (film sets require precision)
- Taking direction (you serve the director's vision)
- Collaboration under pressure (tight deadlines, live shoots)
- Asynchronous work (post-production workflows)

Building solo for 2 years taught me ownership and self-direction. But I'm excited to collaborate again because I know teams produce better outcomes than individuals. I want to learn from experienced engineers and contribute to something bigger than solo projects."

---

### "Your experience seems scattered / not deep in one thing"

**Response:**
"I see it differently: I'm a full-stack product builder, which requires breadth.

To ship a complete product, you need: frontend, backend, databases, infrastructure, testing, deployment, and marketing. I've built that end-to-end capability across 40 projects.

For this role specifically [Solutions Engineer / Product Engineer / etc.], breadth is the superpower. Customers don't have narrow problems — they need complete solutions. My ability to understand and build across the stack means I can solve their problems fully, not just hand off pieces to other teams.

That said, I do have depth in specific areas: [AI automation / real-time systems / API integration / etc.]. Happy to dive deep on any of those."

## MINDSET & MOTIVATION

### Remember This:

**You have a RARE combination:**
- AI-native building (most developers don't know how to leverage AI)
- Film background (creative + technical is rare)
- Shipping bias (40+ apps proves you execute)
- Business understanding (you've built products that make money)
- Video production (massive advantage for devrel, marketing, demos)

**You're not trying to be a traditional developer. You're a new category:**
- AI Automation Specialist
- Product Builder
- Solutions Engineer
- Implementation Specialist

**These roles are GROWING faster than supply. You're early to a trend.**

---

### When Rejection Happens:

1. **It's a numbers game:** 100 applications = 5-10 interviews = 1-2 offers
2. **Rejection isn't personal:** Companies have specific needs, timing, budgets
3. **Each no gets you closer to yes:** Learn from each interview
4. **You only need ONE yes:** That's it. One great offer.

---

### Your Advantage:

Most people applying to these jobs:
- ❌ Can't ship complete products
- ❌ Don't have 40+ portfolio projects
- ❌ Can't create video content
- ❌ Don't understand AI workflows
- ❌ Haven't deployed to production

You:
- ✅ Ship complete products solo
- ✅ Have 40+ real projects
- ✅ Professional video production skills
- ✅ AI-native workflow
- ✅ Production deployment experience

**You're more qualified than you think.**
